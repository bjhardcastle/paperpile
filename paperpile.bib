                 movements of flying blowflies, were replayed on a panoramic
                 stimulus device. The directional movement-sensitive H1 neuron
                 was recorded from blowflies watching these stimuli. The
                 response of the H1 neuron is dominated by the response to fast
                 saccadic turns into one direction. The response between
                 saccades is mostly inhibited by the front-to-back optic flow
                 caused by the forward translation during flight. To unravel
                 the functional significance of the H1 neuron, we replayed, in
                 addition to the original behaviorally generated stimulus, two
                 targeted stimulus modifications: (1) a stimulus in which flow
                 resulting from translation was removed (this stimulus produced
                 strong intersaccadic responses); and (2) a stimulus in which
                 the saccades were removed by assuming that the head follows
                 the smooth flight trajectory (this stimulus produced
                 alternating zero or nearly saturating spike rates). The
                 responses to the two modified stimuli are strongly different
                 from the response to the original stimulus, showing the
                 importance of translation and saccades for the H1 response to
                 natural optic flow. The response to the original stimulus thus
                 suggests a double function for the H1 neuron, assisting two
                 major classes of movement-sensitive output neurons targeted by
                 H1. First, its strong response to saccades may function as a
                 saccadic suppressor (via one of its target neurons) for cells
                 involved in figure-ground discrimination. Second, its
                 intersaccadic response may increase the signal-to-noise ratio
                 (SNR) of wide-field neurons involved in detecting
                 translational optic flow between saccades, in particular when
                 flying speeds are low or when object distances are large.",

                 at least a million species, accounting for more than half of
                 all known living organisms: they are the most successful group
                 in the animal kingdom, found in almost all environments of the
                 planet, ranging in body size from a mere 0.1 mm up to half a
                 meter. Their eyes, together with the respective parts of the
                 nervous system dedicated to the processing of visual
                 information, have long been the subject of intense
                 investigation but, with the exception of some very basic
                 reflexes, it is still not possible to link an insect's visual
                 input to its behavioral output. Fortunately for the field, the
                 fruit fly Drosophila is an insect, too. This genetic workhorse

                 tangential neurons is characteristic of a taxon and can differ
                 between taxa having different visual performances.
                 Observations of 12 brachyceran and 4 nematoceran species have
                 identified different behaviors associated with visually
                 stabilized flight. Neuroanatomical comparisons between closely
                 related species having different behaviors and
                 phylogenetically distant species that have similar behaviors
                 suggest that such differences relate to differences of giant
                 tangential cell architecture in the lobula plate. These
                 functionally related differences contrast to anatomical
                 features that reflect phylogenetic affinities. For example,
                 the lobula plates of robber flies, typified by ballistic
                 flight behavior, all differ from other taxa in lacking

                 they possess an extra complement of horizontal cells in their

                 compute elementary motion are conserved across the Diptera,
                 selective pressure has resulted in modifications of their
                 target neurons, thus contributing to the wide variety of

  abstract    = "1.The visually guided flight behaviour of groups of male and
                 femaleSyritta pipiens was filmed at 50 f.p.s. and analysed
                 frame by frame. Sometimes the flies cruise around ignoring
                 each other. At other times males but not females track other
                 flies closely, during which the body axis points accurately
                 towards the leading fly.2.The eyes of males but not females
                 have a forward directed region of enlarged facets where the
                 resolution is 2 to 3 times greater than elsewhere. The
                 inter-ommatidial angle in this ``fovea'' is 0.6°.3.Targets
                 outside the fovea are fixated by accurately directed,
                 intermittent, open-loop body saccades. Fixation of moving
                 targets within the fovea is maintained by ``continuous''
                 tracking in which the angular position of the target on the
                 retina ($\Theta$e) is continuously translated into the angular
                 velocity of the tracking fly ($$\textbackslashdot
                 \textbackslashPhi _p $$) with a latency of roughly 20 ms
                 ($$\textbackslashdot \textbackslashPhi _p = k
                 \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek≏30 s−1).4.The tracking fly
                 maintains a roughly constant distance (in the range 5--15 cm)
                 from the target. If the distance between the two flies is more
                 than some set value the fly moves forwards, if it is less the
                 fly moves backwards. The forward or backward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p $$) increases with the difference
                 (D-D0) between the actual and desired distance
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p = k^\textbackslashprime (D - D_0
                 )$$), wherek′=10 to 20 s−1). It is argued that the fly
                 computes distance by measuring the vertical substense of the
                 target image on the retina.5.Angular tracking is sometimes, at
                 the tracking fly's choice,supplemented by changes in sideways
                 velocity. The fly predicts a suitable sideways velocity
                 probably on the basis of a running average$\Theta$e, but not
                 its instantaneous value. Alternatively, when the target is
                 almost stationary, angular tracking may bereplaced by sideways
                 tracking. In this case the sideways velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S$$) is related to$\Theta$eabout 30 ms
                 earlier ($$\textbackslashdot S_p = k\textbackslashprime
                 \textbackslashprime \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek″=2.5 cm
                 · s−1 · deg−1), and the angular tracking system is
                 inoperative.6.When the leading fly settles the tracking fly
                 often moves rapidly sideways in an arc centred on the leading
                 fly. During thesevoluntary sideways movements the male
                 continues to point his head at the target. He does this not by
                 correcting$\Theta$e, which is usually zero, but by predicting
                 the angular velocity needed to maintain fixation. This
                 prediction requires knowledge of both the distance between the
                 flies and the tracking fly's sideways velocity. It is shown
                 that the fly tends to over-estimate distance by about
                 20\%.7.When two males meet head on during tracking the pursuit
                 may be cut short as a result of vigorous sideways oscillations
                 of both flies. These side-to-side movements are synchronised
                 so that the males move in opposite directions, and the
                 oscillations usually grow in size until the males separate.
                 The angular tracking system is active during ``wobbling'' and
                 it is shown that to synchronise the two flies the sideways
                 tracking system must also be operative. The combined action of
                 both systems in the two flies leads to instability and so
                 provides a simple way of automatically separating two
                 males.8.Tracking is probably sexual in function and often
                 culminates in a rapid dart towards the leading fly, after the
                 latter has settled. During these ``rapes'' the male
                 accelerates continuously at about 500 cm · s−2, turning just
                 before it lands so that it is in the copulatory position. The
                 male rapes flies of either sex indicating that successful
                 copulation involves more trial and error than
                 recognition.9.During cruising flight the angular velocity of
                 the fly is zero except for brief saccadic turns. There is
                 often a sideways component to flight which means that the body
                 axis is not necessarily in the direction of flight. Changes in
                 flight direction are made either by means of saccades or by
                 adjusting the ratio of sideways to forward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$). Changes in body
                 axis are frequently made without any change in the direction
                 of flight. On these occasions, when the fly makes an angular
                 saccade, it simultaneously adjusts$$\textbackslashdot
                 S/\textbackslashdot F$$by an appropriate amount.10.Flies
                 change course when they approach flowers using the same
                 variety of mechanisms: a series of saccades, adjustments
                 to$$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$, or by a mixture
                 of the two.11.The optomotor response, which tends to prevent
                 rotation except during saccades, is active both during
                 cruising and tracking flight.",

  abstract    = "In the blowfly, the direction-selective response of the 60
                 lobula-plate tangential cells has been ascribed to the
                 integration of local motion information across their extensive
                 dendritic trees. Because the lobula plate is organized
                 retinotopically, the receptive fields of the tangential cells
                 ought to be determined by their dendritic architecture.
                 However, this appears not always to be the case. One
                 compelling example is the exceptionally wide receptive fields
                 of the vertical system (VS) tangential cells. Using
                 dual-intracellular recordings, Haag and Borst (2004) found VS
                 cells to be mutually coupled in such a way that each VS cell
                 is connected exclusively to its immediate neighbors. This
                 coupling may form the basis of the broad receptive fields of
                 VS cells. Here, we tested this hypothesis directly by
                 photoablating individual VS cells. The receptive field width
                 of VS cells indeed narrowed after the ablation of single VS
                 cells, specifically depending on whether the receptive field
                 of the ablated cell was more frontal or more posterior to the
                 recorded cell. In particular, the responses changed as if the
                 neuron lost access to visual information from the ablated
                 neuron and those VS cells more distal than it from the
                 recorded neuron. These experiments provide strong evidence
                 that the lateral connections among VS cells are a crucial
                 component in the mechanism underlying their complex receptive

                 hovering flight dynamics for dipteran insects. The
                 quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including
                 perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid
                 body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a
                 Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification
                 tools are used to identify the transfer functions from
                 biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states.
                 Stability derivatives and a state space linear system
                 describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle
                 control requirements are quantified with respect to
                 traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The
                 heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the
                 pitch/fore/aft dynamics. The haltere-on system revealed a
                 stabilized system with a slow (heave) and fast subsidence
                 mode, and a stable oscillatory mode. The haltere-off (bare

                 Hz contrast frequency for gratings of spatial wavelength 15
                 degrees). To investigate the neural basis of these movements
                 we have combined videomicroscopy with electrophysiological
                 stimulation and recording to demonstrate that excitation of
                 prothoracic motor neurons projecting in the anterodorsal (ADN)
                 and frontal nerves (FN), respectively, generates the yaw and
                 roll head movements measured behaviorally. Electrical
                 stimulation of the ADN produces head yaw. The visual stimuli
                 which excite the two ADN motor neurons (ADN MNs) are
                 horizontal motion of gratings or spots moving clockwise around
                 the yaw axis in the case of the right ADN (counterclockwise
                 for left ADN). Activity is inhibited by motion in the opposite
                 direction. Spatial sensitivity varies in the yaw plane with a
                 maximum between 0 degree and 40 degrees ipsilaterally, but
                 both excitation and inhibition are elicited out to 80 degrees
                 in the ipsilateral and contralateral fields. ADN MNs respond
                 to contrast frequencies up to 15-20 Hz, with a peak around 2-4
                 Hz for grating motion in the excitatory or inhibitory
                 directions. Electrical stimulation of the FN primarily elicits
                 roll down to the ipsilateral side. The one FN MN consistently
                 driven by visual stimulation is excited by downward motion and
                 inhibited by upward motion at 80 degrees azimuth in the
                 ipsilateral visual field. At -80 degrees contralateral, visual
                 motion has the opposite effect: Upward is excitatory and
                 downward is inhibitory. The FN MN is tuned to contrast
                 frequencies in the same range as the ADN MNs, with peak

                 velocities induces motion adaptation, but the neural
                 mechanisms are unclear. We have isolated two mechanisms that
                 act on directionally selective motion-sensitive neurons in the
                 fly's visual system. Both are driven strongly by movement and
                 weakly, if at all, by flicker. The first mechanism, a
                 subtractive process, is directional and is only activated by
                 stimuli that excite the neuron. The second, a reduction in
                 contrast gain, is strongly recruited by motion in any
                 direction, even if the adapting stimulus does not excite the
                 cell. These mechanisms are well designed to operate
                 effectively within the context of motion coding. They can
                 prevent saturation at susceptible nonlinear stages in
                 processing, cope with rapid changes in direction, and preserve

                 system}",
  author      = "Huston, S J and Krapp, H G",
  abstract    = "For sensory signals to control an animal's behavior, they must
                 first be transformed into a format appropriate for use by its
                 motor systems. This fundamental problem is faced by all
                 animals, including humans. Beyond simple reflexes, little is
                 known about how such sensorimotor transformations take place.
                 Here we describe how the outputs of a well- characterized
                 population of fly visual interneurons, lobula plate tangential
                 cells (LPTCs), are used by the animal's gaze- stabilizing neck
                 motor system. The LPTCs respond to visual input arising from
                 both self-rotations and translations of the fly. The neck
                 motor system however is involved in gaze stabilization and
                 thus mainly controls compensatory head rotations. We
                 investigated how the neck motor system is able to selectively
                 extract rotation information from the mixed responses of the
                 LPTCs. We recorded extracellularly from fly neck motor neurons
                 (NMNs) and mapped the directional preferences across their
                 extended visual receptive fields. Our results suggest
                 that---like the tangential cells---NMNs are tuned to panoramic
                 retinal image shifts, or optic flow fields, which occur when
                 the fly rotates about particular body axes. In many cases,
                 tangential cells and motor neurons appear to be tuned to
                 similar axes of rotation, resulting in a correlation between
                 the coordinate systems the two neural populations employ.
                 However, in contrast to the primarily monocular receptive
                 fields of the tangential cells, most NMNs are sensitive to
                 visual motion presented to either eye. This results in the
                 NMNs being more selective for rotation than the LPTCs. Thus,
                 the neck motor system increases its rotation selectivity by a
                 comparatively simple mechanism: the integration of binocular
                 visual motion information.",

  abstract    = "Animals use information from multiple sensory organs to
                 generate appropriate behavior. Exactly how these different
                 sensory inputs are fused at the motor system is not well
                 understood. Here we study how fly neck motor neurons integrate
                 information from two well characterized sensory systems:
                 visual information from the compound eye and gyroscopic
                 information from the mechanosensory halteres. Extracellular
                 recordings reveal that a subpopulation of neck motor neurons
                 display ``gating-like'' behavior: they do not fire action
                 potentials in response to visual stimuli alone but will do so
                 if the halteres are coactivated. Intracellular recordings show
                 that these motor neurons receive small, sustained subthreshold
                 visual inputs in addition to larger inputs that are phase
                 locked to haltere movements. Our results suggest that the
                 nonlinear gating-like effect results from summation of these
                 two inputs with the action potential threshold providing the
                 nonlinearity. As a result of this summation, the sustained
                 visual depolarization is transformed into a temporally
                 structured train of action potentials synchronized to the
                 haltere beating movements. This simple mechanism efficiently
                 fuses two different sensory signals and may also explain the

  abstract    = "Flying blowflies shift their gaze by saccadic turns of body
                 and head, keeping their gaze basically fixed between saccades.
                 For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic
                 flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly
                 motion pathway to extract information about translation of the
                 animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the
                 environment. There are noticeable differences between head and
                 body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and
                 shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more
                 stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we
                 analyse the functional importance of these differences by
                 probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with
                 optic flow based on either head movements or body movements,
                 as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique.
                 We find that the precise head-body coordination is essential
                 for the visual system to separate the translational from the
                 rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the
                 body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the
                 behaviourally important information on translation. Since it
                 is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental
                 paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video
                 techniques, we introduce a 'headifying algorithm', which
                 transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight
                 into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application
                 of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation
                 between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable
                 recovering information on translation. The algorithm may
                 therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed

  abstract    = "Humans, animals and some mobile robots use visual motion cues
                 for object detection and navigation in structured
                 surroundings. Motion is commonly sensed by large arrays of
                 small field movement detectors, each preferring motion in a
                 particular direction. Self-motion generates distinct 'optic
                 flow fields' in the eyes that depend on the type and direction
                 of the momentary locomotion (rotation, translation). To
                 investigate how the optic flow is processed at the neuronal
                 level, we recorded intracellularly from identified
                 interneurons in the third visual neuropile of the blowfly. The
                 distribution of local motion tuning over their huge receptive
                 fields was mapped in detail. The global structure of the
                 resulting 'motion response fields' is remarkably similar to
                 optic flow fields. Thus, the organization of the receptive
                 fields of the so-called VS neurons strongly suggests that each
                 of these neurons specifically extracts the rotatory component
                 of the optic flow around a particular horizontal axis. Other

  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the
                 scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.",

                 interneurons during tethered flight, but this technique

                 compound eyes. Although the ocelli can detect only changes in
                 light intensity averaged over their large visual field, they
                 do play various roles in the behavior of insects, as they have
                 advantages over compound eyes in terms of photic sensitivity
                 and the speed of signal transmission. I summarize here our
                 present knowledge on the neural organization of ocellar
                 systems of a number of insects, and propose that they can be
                 classified into three types: (1) the ``cockroach type''
                 ocellar system where signals from the photoreceptors first
                 converge onto a small number of second-order neurons, and then
                 diverge to a large number of third-order neurons which project
                 into a number of target neuropils of the brain; (2) the ``bee
                 type'' ocellar system where photoreceptor signals are passed
                 to various target neuropils by a large number of second-order
                 neurons; and (3) the ``locust type'' ocellar system where
                 ocellar signals are transmitted to various target neuropils by
                 both second- and third-order neurons. I propose that: (1) the
                 ``cockroach type'' ocellar system can be characterized as a
                 sensitive type where higher sensitivity is attained because of
                 the higher ratio of convergence of photoreceptor signals onto
                 second-order neurons; (2) the ``bee type'' ocellar system is a
                 fast type where a high speed of signal transmission is
                 attained at the possible cost of sensitivity; and (3) the
                 ``locust type'' ocellar system is an intermediate type where
                 both speed and sensitivity are emphasized. A possible
                 phylogenetic relationship between the three types of ocellar

                 important for the blowfly, whose aerodynamic instability
                 permits outstanding maneuverability but increases the demands
                 placed on flight control. Flies use several sensory systems to
                 drive reflex responses, and recent studies have provided
                 access to the circuitry responsible for combining and
                 employing these sensory inputs. We report that lobula plate VS
                 neurons combine inputs from two optical sensors, the ocelli
                 and the compound eyes. Both systems deliver essential

                 variability of responses to visual stimuli. We show here that
                 the information conveyed by an action potential depends on the
                 duration of the immediately preceding interspike interval
                 (ISI). The interspike intervals can be grouped into several
                 different classes on the basis of reproducible features in the
                 interspike interval histograms. Spikes in different classes
                 bear different relationships to the visual stimulus, both
                 qualitatively (in terms of the average stimulus preceding each
                 spike) and quantitatively (in terms of the amount of
                 information encoded per spike and per second). Spikes preceded

                 are largely mediated by the visual control of flight. For this
                 reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered
                 insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for

                 an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual
                 stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels
                 composed of an 8 x 8 array of individual LEDs, that may be
                 connected together to 'tile' an experimental environment with
                 controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be
                 extremely bright, with the added flexibility of
                 individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation
                 over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions.
                 Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom
                 software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on
                 the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication

                 animal experiences the same sensory input several times. This
                 variability can arise from stochastic processes inherent to
                 the nervous system. Also, the internal state of an animal may
                 influence a particular behavioural response. In the present
                 study, we analyse the variability of visually induced head
                 pitch responses of tethered blowflies by high-speed
                 cinematography. We found these optomotor responses to be
                 highly variable in amplitude. Most of the variability can be
                 attributed to two different internal states of the flies with
                 high and low optomotor gain, respectively. Even within a given
                 activity state, there is some variability of head optomotor
                 responses. The amount of this variability differs for the two
                 optomotor gain states. Moreover, these two activity states can
                 be distinguished on a fine timescale and without visual
                 stimulation, on the basis of the occurrence of peculiar head
                 jitter movements. Head jitter goes along with high gain
                 optomotor responses and haltere oscillations. Halteres are
                 evolutionary transformed hindwings that oscillate when
                 blowflies walk or fly. Their main function is to serve as

                 motion. To probe how visual systems process compound motion
                 patterns, superimposed visual gratings moving in different
                 directions, plaid stimuli, have been successfully used in
                 vertebrates. Surprisingly, nothing is known about how visually
                 guided insects process plaids. Here, we explored in the
                 blowfly how the well characterized yaw optomotor reflex and
                 the activity of identified visual interneurons depend on plaid
                 stimuli. We show that contrary to previous expectations, the
                 yaw optomotor reflex shows a bimodal directional tuning for
                 certain plaid stimuli. To understand the neural correlates of
                 this behavior, we recorded the responses of a visual
                 interneuron supporting the reflex, the H1 cell, which was also
                 bimodally tuned to the plaid direction. Using a computational
                 model, we identified the essential neural processing steps
                 required to capture the observed response properties. These
                 processing steps have functional parallels with mechanisms
                 found in the primate visual system, despite different
                 biophysical implementations. By characterizing other visual
                 neurons supporting visually guided behaviors, we found
                 responses that ranged from being bimodally tuned to the
                 stimulus direction (component-selective), to responses that
                 appear to be tuned to the direction of the global pattern

                 programmed in its native code, extracts position and

  abstract    = "In the absence of much passive stability, flying insects rely
                 upon active stabilisation, necessitating the provision of rich
                 sensory feedback across a range of modalities. Here we
                 consider from a sensory perspective what quantities flying
                 insects measure, in order to ask from a mechanical perspective
                 why they should want to do so. We consider each of the sensory
                 modalities separately and uncover three general principles.
                 Firstly, we find that insects have evolved to measure changes
                 in kinematic state, rather than absolute state. For example,
                 although the antennae may be loosely thought of as airspeed
                 sensors, we show that they are configured as a sophisticated
                 adaptive sensing system which is much more appropriate for
                 measuring changes in airspeed than absolute airspeed.
                 Secondly, we find that insect sensory systems are tuned to
                 sense self-motion components in specific directions. For
                 example, certain visual interneurons of flies operate as
                 matched filters that are tuned to detect the optic flow fields
                 induced specifically by rotation about one particular axis.
                 Thirdly, we find that insects commonly combine sensory input
                 from across modalities to form composite, multi-modal
                 quantities which they use as feedback to the control system.
                 For example, certain individually identified descending
                 interneurons combine input from the compound eyes, ocelli,
                 antennae, and cephalic wind-sensitive hairs into one composite
                 signal which is then used in flight control. We infer from
                 these three general organisational principles that insects are
                 configured to sense excitation of their natural modes of
                 motion. This natural-mode sensing hypothesis: (1) explains why
                 insects should want to sense changes in state rather than
                 absolute state; (2) predicts what specific directions of
                 motion they should sense, and (3) specifies how sensory input
                 from different modalities should be combined.",

                 a variety of single-cell properties, such as their stimulus
                 tuning, firing rate or gain. All of these factors must be
                 considered to understand how two neurons should be coupled to
                 optimally process stimuli. We quantified the functional effect
                 of an interaction between two optic-flow processing neurons
                 (Vi and H1) in the fly (Lucilia sericata). Using a generative
                 model, we estimated a uni-directional coupling from H1 to Vi.
                 Especially at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the coupling
                 strongly improved the information about optic-flow in Vi. We
                 identified two constraints confining the strength of the

                 inputs by H1 without a concomitant shift of its stimulus

                 binocular integration of visual motion information underlying
                 a head optomotor response. We identified and characterized two
                 cervical nerve motor neurons (called CNMN6 and CNMN7) tuned
                 precisely to an optic flow corresponding to pitch movements of
                 the head. By means of double recordings and dye coupling, we
                 determined that these neurons are connected ipsilaterally to
                 two vertical system cells (VS2 and VS3), and contralaterally
                 to one horizontal system cell (HSS). In addition, CNMN7 turned

                 tuning to the optic flow resulting from pitch movements of the

  abstract    = "Apparent motion stimuli of increasing complexity have been
                 applied to analyse the mechanisms underlying visual motion
                 perception. In the present paper it is investigated how motion
                 detectors respond to three classes of stimuli which are
                 realized as random-dot kinematograms. (i) In the most
                 conventional stimuli, Fourier motion, a group of dots is
                 displaced coherently in a random-dot pattern (ii) In
                 drift-balanced motion stimuli a bar made of static random dots
                 is shifted in front of another random-dot pattern (iii) In the
                 novel class of stimuli, theta motion, an object which is
                 exclusively defined by dot motion into one direction, is
                 moving itself into the opposite direction. It is shown in
                 psychophysical experiments that human observers perceive the
                 direction of object motion in all three classes of stimuli.
                 Simple motion detectors, however, only extract the motion
                 direction of the object in the case of Fourier stimuli, and in
                 the case of drift-balanced stimuli, if a nonlinear
                 preprocessing is assumed. Any of the model alternatives
                 discussed so far just detects the moving dots but not the
                 object in a theta-stimulus, as is illustrated by a
                 combinatorial analysis using a simplified version of a motion
                 detector of the correlation type, which operates on a discrete
                 time scale and takes only discrete values. In order to account
                 for the detection of theta-motion, a model consisting of two
                 hierarchical layers of motion detectors is developed, and
                 simulated for conditions as used in the psychophysical
                 experiments. The perception of theta-motion and the two-layer
                 model is discussed in relation to psychophysical data and
                 theoretical considerations from the literature, to try to
                 incorporate the proposed two-layer model into a general scheme

                 for analyzing the experimental results, starting from the
                 Pois- son process. We find that blowfly photoreceptors, up to
                 frequencies of 50-100 Hz and photon capture rates of up to
                 about 3 · 105/s, operate well within an order of magnitude
                 from ideal photon counters. Photoreceptors signals are
                 transmitted to LMCs through an array of chem- ical synapses.
                 We quantify a lower bound on LMC reliability, which in turn
                 provides a lower bound on synaptic vesicle release rate,
                 assuming Poisson statistics. This bound is much higher than
                 what is found in published direct measurements of vesicle
                 release rates in goldfish bipolar cells, suggesting that
                 release statistics may be significantly sub-Poisson. Finally

                 outside in the field, H1 transmits information at about 50\%

                 acts as a single wide-field sensor that detects changes in
                 light intensity. We challenge this notion by providing
                 evidence that, when light-adapted, the large retinal L-neurons
                 in the median ocellus of the dragonfly respond in a

                 ability is pronounced under UV illumination but weak or
                 nonexistent in green light and is optimal at angular
                 velocities of approximately 750 degrees s(-1). Using a
                 reverse-correlation technique, we analyze the functional
                 organization of the receptive fields of the L-neurons. Our
                 results reveal that L-neurons alter the structure of their
                 linear spatiotemporal receptive fields with changes in the
                 illuminating wavelength, becoming more inseparable and
                 directional in UV light than in green. For moving bars and
                 gratings, the strength of directionality predicted from the
                 receptive fields is consistent with the measured values. Our
                 results strongly suggest that, during the day, the retinal
