  abstract    = "We examine the dynamics of a neural code in the context of
                 stimuli whose statistical properties are themselves evolving
                 dynamically. Adaptation to these statistics occurs over a wide
                 range of timescales-from tens of milliseconds to minutes.
                 Rapid components of adaptation serve to optimize the
                 information that action potentials carry about rapid stimulus
                 variations within the local statistical ensemble, while
                 changes in the rate and statistics of action-potential firing
                 encode information about the ensemble itself, thus resolving
                 potential ambiguities. The speed with which information is
                 optimized and ambiguities are resolved approaches the physical
                 limit imposed by statistical sampling and noise.",

                 of how information obtained by multiple sensory systems is
                 integrated to support coordinated behaviour. In the fly,
                 lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) encode self-motion by
                 integration of signals from the compound eye. The ocelli,
                 which are also capable of self-motion detection, encode
                 wide-field light intensity in the graded potentials of
                 L-neurons. Using extracellular electrode recordings I
                 discovered that an identified neuron, LPTC V1, responds to
                 stimulation of both the compound eyes and the ocelli, which

  abstract    = "The 3 ocelli of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala, grouped
                 close together on the top of the head (Fig. 1), have large,
                 extensively overlapping visual fields. Together they view the
                 entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the
                 lower hemisphere (Figs. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral
                 ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar lens
                 large patterns are im- aged on the receptor mosaic. Because of
                 the astigmatism of the lens, patterns in longitudinal
                 orientations are more accurately represented than in others
                 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, an artifical horizon rotated around
                 the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll.
                 Likewise, changes of overall brightness in the visual field of
                 the median and one lateral ocellus elicit only weak
                 phasic-tonic ``dorsal light responses'' of the animal which
                 supplement the tonic dorsal light responses mediated by the
                 compound eyes (Figs. 9, 10). Our results show that, in
                 Calliphora, the ocelli have little influence on head
                 orientation during flight, and must be assumed to serve other
                 functions.",
