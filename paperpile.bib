                 quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including
                 perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid
                 body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a
                 Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification
                 tools are used to identify the transfer functions from
                 biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states.
                 Stability derivatives and a state space linear system
                 describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle
                 control requirements are quantified with respect to
                 traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The
                 heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the

  abstract    = "Flying blowflies shift their gaze by saccadic turns of body
                 and head, keeping their gaze basically fixed between saccades.
                 For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic
                 flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly
                 motion pathway to extract information about translation of the
                 animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the
                 environment. There are noticeable differences between head and
                 body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and
                 shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more
                 stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we
                 analyse the functional importance of these differences by
                 probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with
                 optic flow based on either head movements or body movements,
                 as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique.
                 We find that the precise head-body coordination is essential
                 for the visual system to separate the translational from the
                 rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the
                 body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the
                 behaviourally important information on translation. Since it
                 is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental
                 paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video
                 techniques, we introduce a 'headifying algorithm', which
                 transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight
                 into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application
                 of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation
                 between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable
                 recovering information on translation. The algorithm may
                 therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed
                 but cannot be measured.",

  title       = "{Motion and vision: why animals move their eyes}",
  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the
                 scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.",

                 that use sensory feedback to maintain trajectories and
                 orientation. Such stabilizing reflexes are critically
                 important for the blowfly, whose aerodynamic instability
                 permits outstanding maneuverability but increases the demands
                 placed on flight control. Flies use several sensory systems to
                 drive reflex responses, and recent studies have provided
                 access to the circuitry responsible for combining and
                 employing these sensory inputs. We report that lobula plate VS
                 neurons combine inputs from two optical sensors, the ocelli
                 and the compound eyes. Both systems deliver essential
                 information on in-flight rotations, but our neuronal

                 three axes, whereas the compound eyes encode in nine. The
                 difference in dimensionality is reconciled by tuning each VS
                 neuron to the ocellar axis closest to its compound eye axis.
                 We suggest that this simple projection combines the speed of
                 the ocelli with the accuracy of the compound eyes without
                 compromising either. Our findings also support the suggestion
                 that the coordinates of sensory information processing are
                 aligned with axes controlling the natural modes of the fly's

                 close together on the top of the head (Fig. 1), have large,
                 extensively overlapping visual fields. Together they view the
                 entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the
                 lower hemisphere (Figs. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral
                 ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar lens
                 large patterns are im- aged on the receptor mosaic. Because of
                 the astigmatism of the lens, patterns in longitudinal

                 the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll.
