  abstract    = "In the absence of much passive stability, flying insects rely
                 upon active stabilisation, necessitating the provision of rich
                 sensory feedback across a range of modalities. Here we
                 consider from a sensory perspective what quantities flying
                 insects measure, in order to ask from a mechanical perspective
                 why they should want to do so. We consider each of the sensory
                 modalities separately and uncover three general principles.
                 Firstly, we find that insects have evolved to measure changes
                 in kinematic state, rather than absolute state. For example,
                 although the antennae may be loosely thought of as airspeed
                 sensors, we show that they are configured as a sophisticated
                 adaptive sensing system which is much more appropriate for
                 measuring changes in airspeed than absolute airspeed.
                 Secondly, we find that insect sensory systems are tuned to
                 sense self-motion components in specific directions. For
                 example, certain visual interneurons of flies operate as
                 matched filters that are tuned to detect the optic flow fields
                 induced specifically by rotation about one particular axis.
                 Thirdly, we find that insects commonly combine sensory input
                 from across modalities to form composite, multi-modal
                 quantities which they use as feedback to the control system.
                 For example, certain individually identified descending
                 interneurons combine input from the compound eyes, ocelli,
                 antennae, and cephalic wind-sensitive hairs into one composite
                 signal which is then used in flight control. We infer from
                 these three general organisational principles that insects are
                 configured to sense excitation of their natural modes of
                 motion. This natural-mode sensing hypothesis: (1) explains why
                 insects should want to sense changes in state rather than
                 absolute state; (2) predicts what specific directions of
                 motion they should sense, and (3) specifies how sensory input
                 from different modalities should be combined.",

  author      = "Morante, Javier and Desplan, Claude",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Color vision requires comparison between
                 photoreceptors that are sensitive to different wavelengths of
                 light. In Drosophila, this is achieved by the inner
                 photoreceptors (R7 and R8) that contain different rhodopsins.
                 Two types of comparisons can occur in fly color vision:
                 between the R7 (UV sensitive) and R8 (blue- or green
                 sensitive) photoreceptor cells within one ommatidium (unit
                 eye) or between different ommatidia that contain spectrally
                 distinct inner photoreceptors. Photoreceptors project to the
                 optic lobes: R1-R6, which are involved in motion detection,
                 project to the lamina, whereas R7 and R8 reach deeper in the
                 medulla. This paper analyzes the neural network underlying
                 color vision into the medulla. RESULTS: We reconstruct the
                 neural network in the medulla, focusing on neurons likely to
                 be involved in processing color vision. We identify the full
                 complement of neurons in the medulla, including second-order
                 neurons that contact both R7 and R8 from a single ommatidium,
                 or contact R7 and/or R8 from different ommatidia. We also
                 examine third-order neurons and local neurons that likely
                 modulate information from second-order neurons. Finally, we
                 present highly specific tools that will allow us to
                 functionally manipulate the network and test both activity and
                 behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This precise characterization of the
                 medulla circuitry will allow us to understand how color vision
                 is processed in the optic lobe of Drosophila, providing a
                 paradigm for more complex systems in vertebrates.",

  abstract    = "1. Three descending brain interneurons (DNI, DNM, DNC) are
                 described fromLocusta migratoria. All are paired, dorsally
                 situated neurons, with soma in the protocerebrum, input
                 dendrites in the proto- and deuterocerebrum, and a single axon
                 running to the metathoracic ganglion and sometimes further. 2.
                 In DNI the soma and all cerebral arborizations lie ipsilateral
                 to the axon. Discrete regions of arborization lie in the
                 ipsilateral and medial ocellar tracts, the midprotocerebrum
                 and the deuterocerebrum. In the other ganglia the axon
                 branches only ipsilaterally, principally laterally in the
                 flight motor neuropil but also towards the midline. 3. DNC is
                 similarly organized to DNI, but the cell crosses the midline
                 in the brain. Soma, the single projection into a lateral
                 ocellar tract, and the midprotocerebral arborization all lie
                 contralateral to the axon. The deuterocerebral arborization
                 is, however, ipsilateral to the axon. The pattern of
                 projections in the remaining ganglia resembles that of DNI. 4.
                 The soma and all cerebral arborizations of DNM lie ipsilateral
                 to the axon. The arborization is only weakly subdivided into
                 protocerebral, deuterocerebral and medial ocellar tract
                 regions. In the remaining ganglia the arborization extends
                 bilaterally to similar areas of both left and right flight
                 motor neuropil. 5. A table of synonomy is given, equating the
                 various names used for these neurons by previous authors. 6.
                 The morphology correlates well with the known input and output
                 connections. They respond physiologically to deviations from
                 the normal flight posture mediated by ocelli, eyes and wind

                 entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the
                 lower hemisphere (Figs. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral
                 ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar lens
                 large patterns are im- aged on the receptor mosaic. Because of
                 the astigmatism of the lens, patterns in longitudinal
                 orientations are more accurately represented than in others
                 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, an artifical horizon rotated around
                 the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll.
                 Likewise, changes of overall brightness in the visual field of

                 for analyzing the experimental results, starting from the
                 Pois- son process. We find that blowfly photoreceptors, up to
                 frequencies of 50-100 Hz and photon capture rates of up to
                 about 3 · 105/s, operate well within an order of magnitude
                 from ideal photon counters. Photoreceptors signals are
                 transmitted to LMCs through an array of chem- ical synapses.
                 We quantify a lower bound on LMC reliability, which in turn
                 provides a lower bound on synaptic vesicle release rate,
                 assuming Poisson statistics. This bound is much higher than
                 what is found in published direct measurements of vesicle
                 release rates in goldfish bipolar cells, suggesting that
                 release statistics may be significantly sub-Poisson. Finally
                 we study H1, a motion sensitive tangential cell in the fly's
                 lobula plate, which transmits information about a continuous
                 signal by sequences of action potentials. In an experiment
                 with naturalistic motion stimuli performed on a sunny day
                 outside in the field, H1 transmits information at about 50\%
                 coding efficiency down to millisecond spike timing precision.

                 L-neurones of other insects, or large second-order neurones of
                 the fly compound eye, blowfly L-neurones hyperpolarise in
                 response to increases in light intensity and depolarise in
                 response to decreases in light intensity. Both polarities of
                 response have a strong phasic component. Adaptation to
                 sustained illumination shifts the intensity­response curve,

                 an L-neurone with small currents causes an increase in input

                 in the membrane potential. The amplitude of the oscillations
                 increases with current strength. Repolarisation generates
                 brief rebound spikes of variable amplitude. 5. Injection of
                 small hyperpolarising currents increases the amplitude of a
                 response to a subsaturating pulse of light. This effect is not

                 neurons respond almost exclusively to movement of the animal
                 in space about its three axes of rotation. All are spatially
                 and directionally selective. Movements in the preferred sense
                 produce increasingly strong responses with amplitude and
                 absolute position, while movements in the antipreferred sense
                 usually elict no response at all. Movements in the preferred
                 sense, but towards, rather than away from, the normal flying
                 position start to produce responses only as the animal
                 approaches the normal flight position. The neurons function as
                 feature detectors, responding only to specific sorts of
                 deviation from course. 3. DNI, DNM and DNC differ from one
                 another principally in their directionality. DNI responds

                 generate appropriate behavior. Exactly how these different
                 sensory inputs are fused at the motor system is not well
                 understood. Here we study how fly neck motor neurons integrate
                 information from two well characterized sensory systems:
                 visual information from the compound eye and gyroscopic
                 information from the mechanosensory halteres. Extracellular
                 recordings reveal that a subpopulation of neck motor neurons
                 display ``gating-like'' behavior: they do not fire action
                 potentials in response to visual stimuli alone but will do so
                 if the halteres are coactivated. Intracellular recordings show
                 that these motor neurons receive small, sustained subthreshold
                 visual inputs in addition to larger inputs that are phase
                 locked to haltere movements. Our results suggest that the
                 nonlinear gating-like effect results from summation of these
                 two inputs with the action potential threshold providing the
                 nonlinearity. As a result of this summation, the sustained
                 visual depolarization is transformed into a temporally
                 structured train of action potentials synchronized to the
                 haltere beating movements. This simple mechanism efficiently
                 fuses two different sensory signals and may also explain the
                 context-dependent effects of visual inputs on fly behavior.",

                 compound eyes. Although the ocelli can detect only changes in
                 light intensity averaged over their large visual field, they
                 do play various roles in the behavior of insects, as they have
                 advantages over compound eyes in terms of photic sensitivity
                 and the speed of signal transmission. I summarize here our
                 present knowledge on the neural organization of ocellar
                 systems of a number of insects, and propose that they can be
                 classified into three types: (1) the ``cockroach type''
                 ocellar system where signals from the photoreceptors first
                 converge onto a small number of second-order neurons, and then
                 diverge to a large number of third-order neurons which project
                 into a number of target neuropils of the brain; (2) the ``bee
                 type'' ocellar system where photoreceptor signals are passed
                 to various target neuropils by a large number of second-order
                 neurons; and (3) the ``locust type'' ocellar system where
                 ocellar signals are transmitted to various target neuropils by
                 both second- and third-order neurons. I propose that: (1) the
                 ``cockroach type'' ocellar system can be characterized as a
                 sensitive type where higher sensitivity is attained because of
                 the higher ratio of convergence of photoreceptor signals onto
                 second-order neurons; (2) the ``bee type'' ocellar system is a
                 fast type where a high speed of signal transmission is
                 attained at the possible cost of sensitivity; and (3) the
                 ``locust type'' ocellar system is an intermediate type where
                 both speed and sensitivity are emphasized. A possible

  abstract    = "Flying blowflies shift their gaze by saccadic turns of body
                 and head, keeping their gaze basically fixed between saccades.
                 For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic
                 flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly
                 motion pathway to extract information about translation of the
                 animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the
                 environment. There are noticeable differences between head and
                 body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and
                 shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more
                 stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we
                 analyse the functional importance of these differences by
                 probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with
                 optic flow based on either head movements or body movements,
                 as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique.
                 We find that the precise head-body coordination is essential
                 for the visual system to separate the translational from the
                 rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the
                 body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the
                 behaviourally important information on translation. Since it
                 is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental
                 paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video
                 techniques, we introduce a 'headifying algorithm', which
                 transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight
                 into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application
                 of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation
                 between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable
                 recovering information on translation. The algorithm may
                 therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed

                 Hz contrast frequency for gratings of spatial wavelength 15
                 degrees). To investigate the neural basis of these movements
                 we have combined videomicroscopy with electrophysiological
                 stimulation and recording to demonstrate that excitation of
                 prothoracic motor neurons projecting in the anterodorsal (ADN)
                 and frontal nerves (FN), respectively, generates the yaw and
                 roll head movements measured behaviorally. Electrical
                 stimulation of the ADN produces head yaw. The visual stimuli
                 which excite the two ADN motor neurons (ADN MNs) are
                 horizontal motion of gratings or spots moving clockwise around
                 the yaw axis in the case of the right ADN (counterclockwise
                 for left ADN). Activity is inhibited by motion in the opposite
                 direction. Spatial sensitivity varies in the yaw plane with a
                 maximum between 0 degree and 40 degrees ipsilaterally, but
                 both excitation and inhibition are elicited out to 80 degrees
                 in the ipsilateral and contralateral fields. ADN MNs respond
                 to contrast frequencies up to 15-20 Hz, with a peak around 2-4
                 Hz for grating motion in the excitatory or inhibitory
                 directions. Electrical stimulation of the FN primarily elicits
                 roll down to the ipsilateral side. The one FN MN consistently
                 driven by visual stimulation is excited by downward motion and
                 inhibited by upward motion at 80 degrees azimuth in the
                 ipsilateral visual field. At -80 degrees contralateral, visual
                 motion has the opposite effect: Upward is excitatory and
                 downward is inhibitory. The FN MN is tuned to contrast
                 frequencies in the same range as the ADN MNs, with peak
                 sensitivity around 4 Hz. The functional organization of inputs

                 flow processing neurons of the fly Calliphora vicina to
                 determine the preferred location and direction of local motion

                 response from mosquitos yet is innately aversive to Drosophila
                 melanogaster despite being a plentiful byproduct of attractive
                 fermenting food sources. Prior studies used walking flies
                 exclusively, yet adults track distant food sources on the
                 wing. Here we show that a fly tethered within a magnetic field
                 allowing free rotation about the yaw axis actively seeks a
                 narrow CO(2) plume during flight. Genetic disruption of the
                 canonical CO(2)-sensing olfactory neurons does not alter
                 in-flight attraction to CO(2); however, antennal ablation and
                 genetic disruption of the Ir64a acid sensor do. Surprisingly,
                 mutation of the obligate olfactory coreceptor (Orco) does not
                 abolish CO(2) aversion during walking yet eliminates CO(2)
                 tracking in flight. The biogenic amine octopamine regulates
                 critical physiological processes during flight, and blocking
                 synaptic output from octopamine neurons inverts the valence
                 assigned to CO(2) and elicits an aversive response in flight.
                 Combined, our results suggest that a novel Orco-mediated
                 olfactory pathway that gains sensitivity to CO(2) in flight
                 via changes in octopamine levels, along with Ir64a, quickly
                 switches the valence of a key environmental stimulus in a

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: Many insects exploit skylight polarization as a
                 compass cue for orientation and navigation. In the fruit fly,
                 Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptors R7 and R8 in the
                 dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eye are specialized to
                 detect the electric vector (e-vector) of linearly polarized
                 light. These photoreceptors are arranged in stacked pairs with
                 identical fields of view and spectral sensitivities, but
                 mutually orthogonal microvillar orientations. As in larger
                 flies, we found that the microvillar orientation of the distal
                 photoreceptor R7 changes in a fan-like fashion along the DRA.
                 This anatomical arrangement suggests that the DRA constitutes
                 a detector for skylight polarization, in which different
                 e-vectors maximally excite different positions in the array.
                 To test our hypothesis, we measured responses to polarized
                 light of varying e-vector angles in the terminals of R7/8
                 cells using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our data
                 confirm a progression of preferred e-vector angles from
                 anterior to posterior in the DRA, and a strict orthogonality
                 between the e-vector preferences of paired R7/8 cells. We
                 observed decreased activity in photoreceptors in response to
                 flashes of light polarized orthogonally to their preferred
                 e-vector angle, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between
                 photoreceptors in the same medullar column, which may serve to
                 increase polarization contrast. Together, our results indicate
                 that the polarization-vision system relies on a spatial map of
                 preferred e-vector angles at the earliest stage of sensory
                 processing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The fly's visual system is
                 an influential model system for studying neural computation,
                 and much is known about its anatomy, physiology, and
                 development. The circuits underlying motion processing have
                 received the most attention, but researchers are increasingly
                 investigating other functions, such as color perception and
                 object recognition. In this work, we investigate the early
                 neural processing of a somewhat exotic sense, called
                 polarization vision. Because skylight is polarized in an
                 orientation that is rigidly determined by the position of the
                 sun, this cue provides compass information. Behavioral
                 experiments have shown that many species use the polarization
                 pattern in the sky to direct locomotion. Here we describe the
                 input stage of the fly's polarization-vision system.",

                 important for the blowfly, whose aerodynamic instability
                 permits outstanding maneuverability but increases the demands
                 placed on flight control. Flies use several sensory systems to
                 drive reflex responses, and recent studies have provided
                 access to the circuitry responsible for combining and
                 employing these sensory inputs. We report that lobula plate VS
                 neurons combine inputs from two optical sensors, the ocelli
                 and the compound eyes. Both systems deliver essential
                 information on in-flight rotations, but our neuronal
                 recordings reveal that the ocelli encode this information in
                 three axes, whereas the compound eyes encode in nine. The
                 difference in dimensionality is reconciled by tuning each VS
                 neuron to the ocellar axis closest to its compound eye axis.
                 We suggest that this simple projection combines the speed of

                 compromising either. Our findings also support the suggestion

  abstract    = "1.The visually guided flight behaviour of groups of male and
                 femaleSyritta pipiens was filmed at 50 f.p.s. and analysed
                 frame by frame. Sometimes the flies cruise around ignoring
                 each other. At other times males but not females track other
                 flies closely, during which the body axis points accurately
                 towards the leading fly.2.The eyes of males but not females
                 have a forward directed region of enlarged facets where the
                 resolution is 2 to 3 times greater than elsewhere. The
                 inter-ommatidial angle in this ``fovea'' is 0.6°.3.Targets
                 outside the fovea are fixated by accurately directed,
                 intermittent, open-loop body saccades. Fixation of moving
                 targets within the fovea is maintained by ``continuous''
                 tracking in which the angular position of the target on the
                 retina ($\Theta$e) is continuously translated into the angular
                 velocity of the tracking fly ($$\textbackslashdot
                 \textbackslashPhi _p $$) with a latency of roughly 20 ms
                 ($$\textbackslashdot \textbackslashPhi _p = k
                 \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek≏30 s−1).4.The tracking fly
                 maintains a roughly constant distance (in the range 5--15 cm)
                 from the target. If the distance between the two flies is more
                 than some set value the fly moves forwards, if it is less the
                 fly moves backwards. The forward or backward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p $$) increases with the difference
                 (D-D0) between the actual and desired distance
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p = k^\textbackslashprime (D - D_0
                 )$$), wherek′=10 to 20 s−1). It is argued that the fly
                 computes distance by measuring the vertical substense of the
                 target image on the retina.5.Angular tracking is sometimes, at
                 the tracking fly's choice,supplemented by changes in sideways
                 velocity. The fly predicts a suitable sideways velocity
                 probably on the basis of a running average$\Theta$e, but not
                 its instantaneous value. Alternatively, when the target is
                 almost stationary, angular tracking may bereplaced by sideways
                 tracking. In this case the sideways velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S$$) is related to$\Theta$eabout 30 ms
                 earlier ($$\textbackslashdot S_p = k\textbackslashprime
                 \textbackslashprime \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek″=2.5 cm
                 · s−1 · deg−1), and the angular tracking system is
                 inoperative.6.When the leading fly settles the tracking fly
                 often moves rapidly sideways in an arc centred on the leading
                 fly. During thesevoluntary sideways movements the male
                 continues to point his head at the target. He does this not by
                 correcting$\Theta$e, which is usually zero, but by predicting
                 the angular velocity needed to maintain fixation. This
                 prediction requires knowledge of both the distance between the
                 flies and the tracking fly's sideways velocity. It is shown
                 that the fly tends to over-estimate distance by about
                 20\%.7.When two males meet head on during tracking the pursuit
                 may be cut short as a result of vigorous sideways oscillations
                 of both flies. These side-to-side movements are synchronised
                 so that the males move in opposite directions, and the
                 oscillations usually grow in size until the males separate.
                 The angular tracking system is active during ``wobbling'' and
                 it is shown that to synchronise the two flies the sideways
                 tracking system must also be operative. The combined action of
                 both systems in the two flies leads to instability and so
                 provides a simple way of automatically separating two
                 males.8.Tracking is probably sexual in function and often
                 culminates in a rapid dart towards the leading fly, after the
                 latter has settled. During these ``rapes'' the male
                 accelerates continuously at about 500 cm · s−2, turning just
                 before it lands so that it is in the copulatory position. The
                 male rapes flies of either sex indicating that successful
                 copulation involves more trial and error than
                 recognition.9.During cruising flight the angular velocity of
                 the fly is zero except for brief saccadic turns. There is
                 often a sideways component to flight which means that the body
                 axis is not necessarily in the direction of flight. Changes in
                 flight direction are made either by means of saccades or by
                 adjusting the ratio of sideways to forward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$). Changes in body
                 axis are frequently made without any change in the direction
                 of flight. On these occasions, when the fly makes an angular
                 saccade, it simultaneously adjusts$$\textbackslashdot
                 S/\textbackslashdot F$$by an appropriate amount.10.Flies
                 change course when they approach flowers using the same
                 variety of mechanisms: a series of saccades, adjustments
                 to$$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$, or by a mixture
                 of the two.11.The optomotor response, which tends to prevent
                 rotation except during saccades, is active both during
                 cruising and tracking flight.",

                 hovering flight dynamics for dipteran insects. The
                 quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including
                 perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid
                 body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a

                 tools are used to identify the transfer functions from
                 biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states.
                 Stability derivatives and a state space linear system
                 describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle
                 control requirements are quantified with respect to
                 traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The
                 heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the

  title       = "{Motion and vision: why animals move their eyes}",
  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the
                 scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.",

                 Chittka, Lars and Glover, Beverley J",
  abstract    = "Iridescence is a form of structural coloration, produced by a
                 range of structures, in which hue is dependent on viewing
                 angle [1-4]. One of these structures, the diffraction grating,
                 is found both in animals (for example, beetles [2]) and in
                 plants (on the petals of some animal pollinated flowers [5]).
                 The behavioral impacts of floral iridescence and its potential
                 ecological significance are unknown [6-9]. Animal-pollinated
                 flowers are described as ``sensory billboards'' [10], with
                 many floral features contributing to a conspicuous display
                 that filters prospective pollinators. Yet floral iridescence
                 is more subtle to the human eye than that of many animal
                 displays because the floral diffraction grating is not
                 perfectly regular [5-9]. This presents a puzzle: if the
                 function of petals is to attract pollinators, then flowers
                 might be expected to optimize iridescence to increase
                 showiness. On the other hand, pollinators memorize floral
                 colors as consistent advertisements of reward quality, and
                 iridescence might corrupt flower color identity. Here we
                 tested the trade-off between flower detectability and
                 recognition, requiring bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to
                 identify artificial flowers that varied in pigmentation and
                 degree of iridescence. We find that iridescence does increase
                 target detectability but that ``perfect'' iridescence
                 (produced by an artificial diffraction grating) corrupts
                 target identity and bees make many mistakes. However,
                 ``imperfect'' floral iridescence does not lead to mistaken
                 target identity, while still benefitting flower detectability.
                 We hypothesize that similar trade-offs might be found in the
                 many naturally ``imperfect'' iridescence-producing structures
                 found in animal-animal, as well as other plant-animal,

                 hoverflies",
  author      = "Walker, Simon M and Thomas, Adrian L R and Taylor, Graham K",
  abstract    = "The alula is a hinged flap found at the base of the wings of
                 most brachyceran Diptera. The alula accounts for up to 10 per
                 cent of the total wing area in hoverflies (Syrphidae), and its
                 hinged arrangement allows the wings to be swept back over the
                 thorax and abdomen at rest. The alula is actuated via the
                 third axillary sclerite, which is a component of the wing
                 hinge that is involved in wing retraction and control. The
                 third axillary sclerite has also been implicated in the gear
                 change mechanism of flies. This mechanism allows rapid
                 switching between different modes of wing kinematics, by
                 imposing or removing contact with a mechanical stop limiting
                 movement of the wing during the lower half of the downstroke.
                 The alula operates in two distinct states during
                 flight-flipped or flat-and we hypothesize that its state
                 indicates switching between different flight modes. We used
                 high-speed digital video of free-flying hoverflies (Eristalis
                 tenax and Eristalis pertinax) to investigate whether flipping
                 of the alula was associated with changes in wing and body
                 kinematics. We found that alula state was associated with
                 different distributions of multiple wing kinematic parameters,
                 including stroke amplitude, stroke deviation angle, downstroke
                 angle of incidence and timing of supination. Changes in all of
                 these parameters have previously been linked to gear change in
                 flies. Symmetric flipping of the alulae was associated with
                 changes in the symmetric linear acceleration of the body,
                 while asymmetric flipping of the alulae was associated with
                 asymmetric angular acceleration of the body. We conclude that
                 the wings produce less aerodynamic force when the alula is
                 flipped, largely as a result of the accompanying changes in
                 wing kinematics. The alula changes state at mid-downstroke,
                 which is the point at which the gear change mechanism is known
                 to come into effect. This transition is accompanied by changes
                 in the other wing kinematic parameters. We therefore find that
                 the state of the alula is linked to the same parameters as are
                 affected by the gear change mechanism. We conclude that the
                 state of the alula does indeed indicate the operation of
                 different flight modes in Eristalis, and infer that a likely
                 mechanism for these changes in flight mode is the gear change
                 mechanism.",

                 movements of flying blowflies, were replayed on a panoramic
                 stimulus device. The directional movement-sensitive H1 neuron
                 was recorded from blowflies watching these stimuli. The
                 response of the H1 neuron is dominated by the response to fast
                 saccadic turns into one direction. The response between
                 saccades is mostly inhibited by the front-to-back optic flow
                 caused by the forward translation during flight. To unravel
                 the functional significance of the H1 neuron, we replayed, in
                 addition to the original behaviorally generated stimulus, two
                 targeted stimulus modifications: (1) a stimulus in which flow
                 resulting from translation was removed (this stimulus produced
                 strong intersaccadic responses); and (2) a stimulus in which
                 the saccades were removed by assuming that the head follows
                 the smooth flight trajectory (this stimulus produced
                 alternating zero or nearly saturating spike rates). The
                 responses to the two modified stimuli are strongly different
                 from the response to the original stimulus, showing the
                 importance of translation and saccades for the H1 response to
                 natural optic flow. The response to the original stimulus thus
                 suggests a double function for the H1 neuron, assisting two
                 major classes of movement-sensitive output neurons targeted by
                 H1. First, its strong response to saccades may function as a
                 saccadic suppressor (via one of its target neurons) for cells
                 involved in figure-ground discrimination. Second, its
                 intersaccadic response may increase the signal-to-noise ratio
                 (SNR) of wide-field neurons involved in detecting
                 translational optic flow between saccades, in particular when

                 variability can arise from stochastic processes inherent to
                 the nervous system. Also, the internal state of an animal may
                 influence a particular behavioural response. In the present
                 study, we analyse the variability of visually induced head
                 pitch responses of tethered blowflies by high-speed

                 activity state, there is some variability of head optomotor
                 responses. The amount of this variability differs for the two
                 optomotor gain states. Moreover, these two activity states can
                 be distinguished on a fine timescale and without visual
                 stimulation, on the basis of the occurrence of peculiar head
                 jitter movements. Head jitter goes along with high gain
                 optomotor responses and haltere oscillations. Halteres are
                 evolutionary transformed hindwings that oscillate when
                 blowflies walk or fly. Their main function is to serve as
                 equilibrium organs by detecting Coriolis forces and to mediate
                 gaze stabilisation. However, their basic oscillating activity
                 was also suggested to provide a gain-modulating signal. Our
                 experiments demonstrate that halteres are not necessary for
                 high gain head pitch to occur. Nevertheless, we find the
                 halteres to be responsible for one component of head jitter
                 movements. This component may be the inevitable consequence of
                 their function as equilibrium and gaze-stabilising organs.",

  abstract    = "Flying insects exhibit stunning behavioral repertoires that
                 are largely mediated by the visual control of flight. For this
                 reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered
                 insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for
                 studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create
                 an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual
                 stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels
                 composed of an 8 x 8 array of individual LEDs, that may be
                 connected together to 'tile' an experimental environment with
                 controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be
                 extremely bright, with the added flexibility of
                 individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation
                 over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions.
                 Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom
                 software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on
                 the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication
                 interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based
                 display controller which, for most experiments, will not
                 require a computer in the loop, greatly reducing the

                 interneurons during tethered flight, but this technique
                 generalizes to different cell types and behaviors. We found
                 that the peak-to-peak responses of a class of visual

                 neurons (VS cells), doubled when flies were flying compared

  author      = "Wehner, R and Michel, B and Antonsen, P",
  abstract    = "Social hymenopterans such as bees and ants are central-place
                 foragers; they regularly depart from and return to fixed
                 positions in their environment. In returning to the starting
                 point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they
                 could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation
                 by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference.
                 In the first case, they would rely on information continuously
                 collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e.
                 integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a
                 mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at
                 least by some authors, to use a map-based system of
                 navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of
                 the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental
                 framework. In bees and ants, path integration employing a
                 skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation,
                 but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well.
                 This information is obtained while the animal is
                 dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For
                 example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest
                 entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches
                 the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants
                 (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor
                 intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore,
                 this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural
                 snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of
                 reference. In this way, geocentred information might more and
                 more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred
                 information provided by the path-integration system. In
                 competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees
                 itself of its homeward-bound vector - its safety-line, so to
                 speak - by which it is always linked to home. Vector
                 information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting
                 (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept
                 of the mental analogue of a topographic map - a metric map -
                 assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of
                 vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to
                 interpret the insect's behaviour. The cognitive-map approach
                 in particular, and the representational paradigm in general,
                 are discussed.",

                 sensory input by changes in neuronal activity. Neuronal
                 activity changes, however, also arise from noise sources
                 within and outside the nervous system or from changes of the
                 animal's behavioral state. The resulting variability of
                 neuronal responses in representing sensory stimuli limits the
                 reliability with which animals can respond to stimuli and may
                 thus even affect the chances for survival in certain
                 situations. Relevant sources of noise arising at different
                 stages along the motion vision pathway have been investigated
                 from the sensory input to the initiation of behavioral
                 reactions. Here, we concentrate on the reliability of
                 processing visual motion information in flies. Flies rely on
                 visual motion information to guide their locomotion. They are
                 among the best established model systems for the processing of
                 visual motion information allowing us to bridge the gap
                 between behavioral performance and underlying neuronal
                 computations. It has been possible to directly assess the
                 consequences of noise at major stages of the fly's visual
                 motion processing system on the reliability of neuronal
                 signals. Responses of motion sensitive neurons and their
                 variability have been related to optomotor movements as
                 indicators for the overall performance of visual motion
                 computation. We address whether and how noise already inherent
                 in the stimulus, e.g. photon noise for the visual system,
                 influences later processing stages and to what extent
                 variability at the output level of the sensory system limits
                 behavioral performance. Recent advances in circuit analysis
                 and the progress in monitoring neuronal activity in behaving
                 animals should now be applied to understand how the animal

                 cellular analysis in both intact animal and isolated cell
                 preparations. The distribution of voltage-gated conductances
                 among photoreceptors of different species correlates with
                 visual ecology. Delayed-rectifier K+ channels are found in the
                 rapidly responding photoreceptors of fast-flying flies. The
                 conductance's activation range and dynamics match
                 light-induced signals, and enable a rapid response by reducing
                 the membrane time constant. Slow-moving flies have slowly
                 responding photoreceptors that lack the delayed rectifier, but
                 express an inactivating K+ conductance that is metabolically
                 less demanding. Complementing these findings, locust
                 photoreceptor membranes are modulated diurnally. The delayed
                 rectifier is exhibited during the day and the inactivating K+
                 current is exhibited at night. Insect photoreceptors also
                 demonstrate the amplification of signals by voltage-gated Na+
                 channels. In drone-bee photoreceptors, voltage-gated Na+

                 three simple eyes (ocelli). It is thought that each ocellus
                 acts as a single wide-field sensor that detects changes in
                 light intensity. We challenge this notion by providing
                 evidence that, when light-adapted, the large retinal L-neurons
                 in the median ocellus of the dragonfly respond in a
                 directional way to upward moving bars and gratings. This
                 ability is pronounced under UV illumination but weak or
                 nonexistent in green light and is optimal at angular
                 velocities of approximately 750 degrees s(-1). Using a
                 reverse-correlation technique, we analyze the functional
                 organization of the receptive fields of the L-neurons. Our
                 results reveal that L-neurons alter the structure of their
                 linear spatiotemporal receptive fields with changes in the
                 illuminating wavelength, becoming more inseparable and
                 directional in UV light than in green. For moving bars and
                 gratings, the strength of directionality predicted from the
                 receptive fields is consistent with the measured values. Our
                 results strongly suggest that, during the day, the retinal
                 circuitry of the dragonfly median ocellus performs an early
                 linear stage of motion processing. The likely advantage of

                 system}",
  author      = "Huston, S J and Krapp, H G",
  abstract    = "For sensory signals to control an animal's behavior, they must
                 first be transformed into a format appropriate for use by its
                 motor systems. This fundamental problem is faced by all
                 animals, including humans. Beyond simple reflexes, little is
                 known about how such sensorimotor transformations take place.
                 Here we describe how the outputs of a well- characterized
                 population of fly visual interneurons, lobula plate tangential
                 cells (LPTCs), are used by the animal's gaze- stabilizing neck
                 motor system. The LPTCs respond to visual input arising from
                 both self-rotations and translations of the fly. The neck
                 motor system however is involved in gaze stabilization and
                 thus mainly controls compensatory head rotations. We
                 investigated how the neck motor system is able to selectively
                 extract rotation information from the mixed responses of the
                 LPTCs. We recorded extracellularly from fly neck motor neurons
                 (NMNs) and mapped the directional preferences across their
                 extended visual receptive fields. Our results suggest
                 that---like the tangential cells---NMNs are tuned to panoramic
                 retinal image shifts, or optic flow fields, which occur when
                 the fly rotates about particular body axes. In many cases,
                 tangential cells and motor neurons appear to be tuned to
                 similar axes of rotation, resulting in a correlation between
                 the coordinate systems the two neural populations employ.
                 However, in contrast to the primarily monocular receptive
                 fields of the tangential cells, most NMNs are sensitive to
                 visual motion presented to either eye. This results in the
                 NMNs being more selective for rotation than the LPTCs. Thus,
                 the neck motor system increases its rotation selectivity by a
                 comparatively simple mechanism: the integration of binocular
                 visual motion information.",

                 patterns, superimposed visual gratings moving in different

                 guided insects process plaids. Here, we explored in the
                 blowfly how the well characterized yaw optomotor reflex and
                 the activity of identified visual interneurons depend on plaid
                 stimuli. We show that contrary to previous expectations, the
                 yaw optomotor reflex shows a bimodal directional tuning for
                 certain plaid stimuli. To understand the neural correlates of
                 this behavior, we recorded the responses of a visual
                 interneuron supporting the reflex, the H1 cell, which was also
                 bimodally tuned to the plaid direction. Using a computational
                 model, we identified the essential neural processing steps
                 required to capture the observed response properties. These
                 processing steps have functional parallels with mechanisms
                 found in the primate visual system, despite different
                 biophysical implementations. By characterizing other visual
                 neurons supporting visually guided behaviors, we found
                 responses that ranged from being bimodally tuned to the
                 stimulus direction (component-selective), to responses that
                 appear to be tuned to the direction of the global pattern

                 understanding of neural mechanisms of motion processing in
                 insects, and indicate that the fly employs a wider range of

                 Observations of 12 brachyceran and 4 nematoceran species have
                 identified different behaviors associated with visually
                 stabilized flight. Neuroanatomical comparisons between closely

                 a particular (preferred) rotation of the fly's head. The fly
                 can also sense rotation using its three ocelli (simple eyes),

                 We report that an individually identified tangential cell, V1,

  abstract    = "In the blowfly, the direction-selective response of the 60
                 lobula-plate tangential cells has been ascribed to the
                 integration of local motion information across their extensive
                 dendritic trees. Because the lobula plate is organized
                 retinotopically, the receptive fields of the tangential cells
                 ought to be determined by their dendritic architecture.
                 However, this appears not always to be the case. One
                 compelling example is the exceptionally wide receptive fields
                 of the vertical system (VS) tangential cells. Using
                 dual-intracellular recordings, Haag and Borst (2004) found VS
                 cells to be mutually coupled in such a way that each VS cell
                 is connected exclusively to its immediate neighbors. This
                 coupling may form the basis of the broad receptive fields of
                 VS cells. Here, we tested this hypothesis directly by
                 photoablating individual VS cells. The receptive field width
                 of VS cells indeed narrowed after the ablation of single VS
                 cells, specifically depending on whether the receptive field
                 of the ablated cell was more frontal or more posterior to the
                 recorded cell. In particular, the responses changed as if the
                 neuron lost access to visual information from the ablated
                 neuron and those VS cells more distal than it from the
                 recorded neuron. These experiments provide strong evidence
                 that the lateral connections among VS cells are a crucial
                 component in the mechanism underlying their complex receptive

  abstract    = "Apparent motion stimuli of increasing complexity have been
                 applied to analyse the mechanisms underlying visual motion
                 perception. In the present paper it is investigated how motion
                 detectors respond to three classes of stimuli which are
                 realized as random-dot kinematograms. (i) In the most
                 conventional stimuli, Fourier motion, a group of dots is
                 displaced coherently in a random-dot pattern (ii) In
                 drift-balanced motion stimuli a bar made of static random dots
                 is shifted in front of another random-dot pattern (iii) In the
                 novel class of stimuli, theta motion, an object which is
                 exclusively defined by dot motion into one direction, is
                 moving itself into the opposite direction. It is shown in
                 psychophysical experiments that human observers perceive the
                 direction of object motion in all three classes of stimuli.
                 Simple motion detectors, however, only extract the motion
                 direction of the object in the case of Fourier stimuli, and in
                 the case of drift-balanced stimuli, if a nonlinear
                 preprocessing is assumed. Any of the model alternatives
                 discussed so far just detects the moving dots but not the
                 object in a theta-stimulus, as is illustrated by a
                 combinatorial analysis using a simplified version of a motion
                 detector of the correlation type, which operates on a discrete
                 time scale and takes only discrete values. In order to account
                 for the detection of theta-motion, a model consisting of two
                 hierarchical layers of motion detectors is developed, and
                 simulated for conditions as used in the psychophysical
                 experiments. The perception of theta-motion and the two-layer
                 model is discussed in relation to psychophysical data and
                 theoretical considerations from the literature, to try to
                 incorporate the proposed two-layer model into a general scheme

                 binocular integration of visual motion information underlying
                 a head optomotor response. We identified and characterized two
                 cervical nerve motor neurons (called CNMN6 and CNMN7) tuned

                 determined that these neurons are connected ipsilaterally to
                 two vertical system cells (VS2 and VS3), and contralaterally
                 to one horizontal system cell (HSS). In addition, CNMN7 turned

                 the haltere is deflected up, down or backwards. 2. The anatomy
                 and action of the neck muscles is described. 3. Cobalt fills
                 of the whole haltere nerve show that the sensory axons project
                 to the neuropiles of the ipsi- and contralateral pro- and
                 mesothoracic neuropiles, to the ipsilateral metathoracic
                 neuropiles and to the cerebral ganglion. 4. Cobalt fills of
                 the nerves to the neck muscles and from the prosternal organs
                 show that the central projections of these nerves end in the
                 ipsilateral prothoracic neuropile. 5. Recordings from the
                 motoneurones to the neck muscles show that they are phasicaJly
                 activated by forward deflexion of the halteres after a latency
                 of 2-5-3 ms. Spikes in the motoneurones follow the vibration
                 of the haltere, one to one, up to 200 Hz. 6. Recordings from
                 the ipsilateral mesothoracic wing nerve (N. alae) show two
                 large units which respond after a 2-5-3 ms latency to forward
                 deflexion of the halteres. 7. Behavioural observations of
                 walking flies show that the presence or absence of halteres
                 has a small but nevertheless significant effect on the
                 animals' ability to detect angular accelerations during
                 walking or to orient with respect to gravity. INTRODUCTION",

                 particularly in light of the considerable trial-to-trial
                 variability of responses to visual stimuli. We show here that
                 the information conveyed by an action potential depends on the
                 duration of the immediately preceding interspike interval
                 (ISI). The interspike intervals can be grouped into several
                 different classes on the basis of reproducible features in the
                 interspike interval histograms. Spikes in different classes
                 bear different relationships to the visual stimulus, both
                 qualitatively (in terms of the average stimulus preceding each
                 spike) and quantitatively (in terms of the amount of
                 information encoded per spike and per second). Spikes preceded
                 by very short intervals (3 msec or less) convey information
                 most efficiently and contribute disproportionately to the
                 overall receptive-field properties of the neuron. Overall, V1
                 neurons can transmit between 5 and 30 bits of information per

                 spot for several seconds and then burst into movement in
                 apparently any possible direction. In order to determine a
                 quantitative and structured description of complex flight
                 manoeuvres, we searched for a set of repeatedly occurring
                 prototypical movements (PMs) and a set of rules for their
                 ordering. PMs were identified by applying clustering
                 algorithms to the translational and rotational velocities of
                 the body of Eristalis during free-flight sequences. This
                 approach led to nine stable and reliable PMs, and thus
                 provided a tremendous reduction in the complexity of
                 behavioural description. This set of PMs together with the
                 probabilities of transition between them constitute a
                 syntactical description of flight behaviour. The PMs
                 themselves can be roughly segregated into fast rotational
                 turns (saccades) and a variety of distinct translational
                 movements (intersaccadic intervals). We interpret this
                 segregation as reflecting an active sensing strategy which
                 facilitates the extraction of spatial information from retinal
                 image displacements. Detailed analysis of saccades shows that

                 horizontally. During flight, blowflies performed a series of
                 short (approximately 20-30 ms) saccade-like turns at a rate of
                 approximately 10 s-1. The saccades consisted of a succession
                 of rotations around all axes, occurring in a fixed order.
                 First, a roll was started. Second, the rolled thorax pitched
                 (pulling the nose up) and yawed, resulting in a turn relative
                 to the outside world. Finally, the thorax rolled back to a
                 level position. Saccades had yaw amplitudes of up to 90
                 degrees, but 90 \% were smaller than 50 degrees. Maximum
                 angular velocities were 2000 degrees s-1, and maximum

                 small field movement detectors, each preferring motion in a
                 particular direction. Self-motion generates distinct 'optic
                 flow fields' in the eyes that depend on the type and direction
                 of the momentary locomotion (rotation, translation). To
                 investigate how the optic flow is processed at the neuronal
                 level, we recorded intracellularly from identified
                 interneurons in the third visual neuropile of the blowfly. The
                 distribution of local motion tuning over their huge receptive

                 fly and compared to the findings obtained in other animal
                 species. Several constraints deter- mine and limit the
                 reliability of encoding of visual motion information: (i) the
                 biophysical mechanisms underlying the generation of action
                 potentials; (ii) the computations performed in the motion
                 vision pathway; and (iii) the dynamical properties of motion
                 stimuli an animal encounters when moving around in its natural
                 environment. The responses of fly motion-sensitive neurones
                 are coupled to visual motion on a timescale of milliseconds up
                 to several tens of milliseconds, depending on the dynamics of
                 the motion stimuli. Only rapid velocity changes lead to a
                 precise time-locking of spikes to the motion stimuli on a
                 millisecond scale. Otherwise, the exact timing of spikes is
                 mainly determined by fast sto- chastic membrane-potential
                 fluctuations. It is discussed on what timescale behav-
                 iourally relevant motion information may be encoded.",

                 responses of sensory neurons in resting versus moving insects.
                 Since the dynamic range of visual motion stimuli strongly
                 depends on the speed at which an animal is moving, we
                 investigated whether the visual system adapts to such changes

                 computation for Fourier motion direction and amplitude, can
                 also encode higher-order signals provided elaborate
                 preprocessing [2-4]. However, the way in which a fly tracks a
                 moving figure containing both elementary and higher-order
                 signals has not been investigated. Using a novel white noise
                 approach, we demonstrate that (1) the composite response to an
                 object containing both elementary motion (EM) and uncorrelated
                 higher-order figure motion (FM) reflects the linear

                 motion information to the motor circuits in the thoracic

  abstract    = "Insects have evolved sophisticated fight control mechanisms
                 permitting a remarkable range of manoeuvres. Here, I present a
                 qualitative analysis of insect flight control from the
                 perspective of flight mechanics, drawing upon both the
                 neurophysiology and biomechanics literatures. The current
                 literature does not permit a formal, quantitative analysis of
                 flight control, because the aerodynamic force systems that
                 biologists have measured have rarely been complete and the
                 position of the centre of gravity has only been recorded in a
                 few studies. Treating the two best-known insect orders
                 (Diptera and Orthoptera) separately from other insects, I
                 discuss the control mechanisms of different insects in detail.
                 Recent experimental studies suggest that the helicopter model
                 of flight control proposed for Drosophila spp. may be better
                 thought of as a facultative strategy for flight control,
                 rather than the fixed (albeit selected) constraint that it is
                 usually interpreted to be. On the other hand, the so-called
                 'constant-lift reaction' of locusts appears not to be a reflex
                 for maintaining constant lift at varying angles of attack, as
                 is usually assumed, but rather a mechanism to restore the
                 insect to pitch equilibrium following a disturbance.
                 Differences in the kinematic control mechanisms used by the
                 various insect orders are related to differences in the
                 arrangement of the wings, the construction of the flight motor
                 and the unsteady mechanisms of lift production that are used.
                 Since the evolution of insect flight control is likely to have
                 paralleled the evolutionary refinement of these unsteady
                 aerodynamic mechanisms, taxonomic differences in the
                 kinematics of control could provide an assay of the relative
                 importance of different unsteady mechanisms. Although the
                 control kinematics vary widely between orders, the number of
                 degrees of freedom that different insects can control will
                 always be limited by the number of independent control inputs
                 that they use. Control of the moments about all three axes (as
                 used by most conventional aircraft) has only been proven for
                 larger flies and dragonflies, but is likely to be widespread
                 in insects given the number of independent control inputs
                 available to them. Unlike in conventional aircraft, however,
                 insects' control inputs are likely to be highly
                 non-orthogonal, and this will tend to complicate the neural
                 processing required to separate the various motions.",

                 metabolically costly, and a hungry animal has limited energy
                 reserves, so we hypothesized that neural activity in other
                 systems may be downregulated by food deprivation. We
                 investigated this hypothesis in the motion vision pathway of
                 the blowfly. Like other animals, flies augment their motion
                 vision when moving: they increase the resting activity and
                 gain of visual interneurons supporting the control of
                 locomotion and gaze. In the present study, walking-induced
                 changes in visual processing depended on the nutritional
                 state-they decreased with food deprivation and recovered after
                 subsequent feeding. We found that changes in the motion vision
                 pathway depended on walking speed in a manner dependent on the
                 nutritional state. Walking also reduced response latencies in
                 visual interneurons, an effect not altered by food
                 deprivation. Finally, the optomotor reflex that compensates
                 for visual wide-field motion was reduced in food-deprived
                 flies. Thus, walking augmented motion vision, but the effect
                 was decreased when energy reserves were low. Our results

  abstract    = "Previous studies of insect flight control have been
                 statistical in approach, simply correlating wing kinematics
                 with body kinematics or force production. Kinematics and
                 forces are linked by Newtonian mechanics, so adopting a
                 dynamics-based approach is necessary if we are to place the
                 study of insect flight on its proper physical footing. Here we
                 develop semi-empirical models of the longitudinal flight
                 dynamics of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria. We use
                 instantaneous force-moment measurements from individual
                 locusts to parametrize the nonlinear rigid body equations of
                 motion. Since the instantaneous forces are approximately
                 periodic, we represent them using Fourier series, which are
                 embedded in the equations of motion to give a nonlinear
                 time-periodic (NLTP) model. This is a proper mathematical
                 generalization of an earlier linear-time invariant (LTI) model
                 of locust flight dynamics, developed using previously
                 published time-averaged versions of the instantaneous force
                 recordings. We perform various numerical simulations, within
                 the fitted range of the model, and across the range of body
                 angles used by free-flying locusts, to explore the likely
                 behaviour of the locusts upon release from the tether.
                 Solutions of the NLTP models are compared with solutions of
                 the nonlinear time-invariant (NLTI) models to which they
                 reduce when the periodic terms are dropped. Both sets of
                 models are unstable and therefore fail to explain locust
                 flight stability fully. Nevertheless, whereas the measured
                 forces include statistically significant harmonic content up
                 to about the eighth harmonic, the simulated flight
                 trajectories display no harmonic content above the fundamental
                 forcing frequency. Hence, manoeuvre control in locusts will
                 not directly reflect subtle changes in the higher harmonics of
                 the wing beat, but must operate on a coarser time-scale. A
                 state-space analysis of the NLTP models reveals orbital
                 trajectories that are impossible to capture in the LTI and
                 NLTI models, and inspires the hypothesis that asymptotic
                 orbital stability is the proper definition of stability in
                 flapping flight. Manoeuvre control on the scale of more than
                 one wing beat would then consist in exciting transients from
                 one asymptotically stable orbit to another. We summarize these
                 hypotheses by proposing a limit-cycle analogy for flapping
                 flight control and suggest experiments for verification of the

                 regulated in aroused states, and several lines of evidence
                 imply that this is mediated at least partly by the
                 serotonergic system. However, there is little information
                 directly showing that serotonergic function is required for
                 state-dependent modulation of sensory processing. Here we find
                 that zebrafish larvae can maintain a short-term state of
                 arousal during which neurons in the dorsal raphe modulate
                 sensory responsiveness to behaviorally relevant visual cues.
                 After a brief exposure to water flow, larvae show elevated
                 activity and heightened sensitivity to perceived motion.
                 Calcium imaging of neuronal activity after flow revealed
                 increased activity in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal
                 raphe. Genetic ablation of these neurons abolished the

                 the panneuronal activity. Our results provide an atlas of

                 such as the sun, the moon, and the polarization pattern, to
                 roll dung balls along straight paths across the savanna.
                 Although nocturnal beetles move in the same manner through the
                 same environment as their diurnal relatives, they do so when
                 light conditions are at least 1 million-fold dimmer. Here, we
                 show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the celestial
                 cue preference differs between nocturnal and diurnal beetles
                 in a manner that reflects their contrasting visual ecologies.
                 We also demonstrate how these cue preferences are reflected in
                 the activity of compass neurons in the brain. At night,
                 polarized skylight is the dominant orientation cue for
                 nocturnal beetles. However, if we coerce them to roll during
                 the day, they instead use a celestial body (the sun) as their
                 primary orientation cue. Diurnal beetles, however, persist in
                 using a celestial body for their compass, day or night.
                 Compass neurons in the central complex of diurnal beetles are
                 tuned only to the sun, whereas the same neurons in the
                 nocturnal species switch exclusively to polarized light at
                 lunar light intensities. Thus, these neurons encode the
                 preferences for particular celestial cues and alter their
                 weighting according to ambient light conditions. This flexible
                 encoding of celestial cue preferences relative to the
                 prevailing visual scenery provides a simple, yet effective,
                 mechanism for enabling visual orientation at any light

  abstract    = "Active locomotive states are metabolically expensive and
                 require efficient sensory processing both to avoid wasteful
                 movements and to cope with an extended bandwidth of sensory
                 stimuli. This is particularly true for flying animals because
                 flight, as opposed to walking or resting, imposes a steplike
                 increase in metabolism for the precise execution and control
                 of movements. Sensory processing itself carries a significant
                 metabolic cost, but the principles governing the adjustment of
                 sensory processing to different locomotor states are not well
                 understood. We use the blowfly as a model system to study the
                 impact on visual processing of a neuromodulator, octopamine,
                 which is known to be involved in the regulation of flight

                 negative signaling range is increased. Meanwhile, the
                 preferred self-motion parameters the cells encode were state

                 rapid, large responses, and high spontaneous spike activity

  author      = "Wilson, Martin",
  abstract    = "This paper examines the optical and physiological organisation
                 of locust ocelli with a view to understanding their function.
                 The approach taken in this work has largely been to correlate
                 quantitative measurements of the spectral, angular and
                 absolute sensitivities of large second order neurons with
                 radiometric data from the natural environment. The resulting
                 estimates of the natural performance of these neurons form the
                 basis for a hypothesis of their functional significance. 1. In
                 both median and lateral ocelli of adult locusts the image
                 plane lies well behind the retina regardless of pupil
                 diameter. It is pointed out that underfocussing confers
                 positive advantages and should be seen as an integral part of
                 ocellar design. 2. The ocellar nerves contain axons that carry
                 graded hyperpolarisations and axons that carry trains of
                 action potentials. Graded potentials are identified with the
                 large (L) neurons. The spiking axons, of which some are
                 light-inhibited and some are light-excited, are thought to be
                 the small (S) neurons. 3. Constriction of the radial pupil
                 during light adaptation causes little diminution of the total
                 field of view of an ocellus. The horizontal extent of the
                 visual fields of L neurons in lateral ocelli, measured
                 electrophysiologically is about 140°, effectively that of the
                 whole retina. These wide fields are consistent with the
                 underfocussed dioptrics and the reported extensive branching
                 of these cells in the subretinal neuropile. 4. Dark adaptation
                 of L neurons following normal preparative procedures takes
                 several hours and increases sensitivity by over 3 log units.
                 Complete dark adaptation is associated with large (up to 10 mV
                 average amplitude) hyperpolarising bumps clearly
                 distinguishable from noise and presumed to result from single
                 photon captures. 5. Using an index of sensitivity that relates
                 to monochromatic stimulation of an eye with an axial point
                 source it is estimated that L neurons are 5 $\times$ more
                 sensitive than compound eye lamina neurons but to an extended
                 source they would be 5000 $\times$ more sensitive. 6. Of 18 L
                 neurons whose spectral sensitivity was examined, all had
                 maximum sensitivity close to 370 nm. A secondary peak at 500
                 nm varied in height from cell to cell between 48\% and 0.3\%
                 of the UV peak. One cell was found in the median ocellus that
                 showed stronger inhibition from green than UV stimuli. It is
                 concluded that color coding by the ocellus is possible. 7. It
                 is suggested that the disposition of locust ocelli, the
                 spectral sensitivity and the temporal and spatial filtering
                 characteristics of their L neurons suit these cells well to
                 the task of detecting instability in flight. This idea is
                 discussed in relation to the anatomy and physiology of ocellar
                 pathways.",

                 binocular motion information tunes wide-field
                 direction-selective neurons in the fly optic lobe to respond
                 preferentially to specific optic flow fields. This is shown by
                 measuring the local preferred directions (LPDs) and local
                 motion sensitivities (LMSs) at many positions within the
                 receptive fields of three types of anatomically identifiable
                 lobula plate tangential neurons: the three horizontal system
                 (HS) neurons, the two centrifugal horizontal (CH) neurons, and
                 three heterolateral connecting elements. The latter impart to
                 two of the HS and to both CH neurons a sensitivity to motion
                 from the contralateral visual field. Thus in two HS neurons

                 butterfly and further complicated by its motion in and out of
                 shadows. Human subjects readily perceive the direction of
                 higher-order motion, although this stands in stark contrast to
                 prevailing motion vision models. Flies and humans compute
                 motion in similar ways, and because flies behaviorally track

                 distinguished by the optical disparity generated by their
                 relative motion against the ground, and yet the neural
                 mechanisms underlying these visual discriminations are not
                 well understood. We show in flies that a diverse array of
                 figure-ground stimuli containing a motion-defined edge elicit
                 statistically similar behavioral responses to one another, and
                 statistically distinct behavioral responses from ground motion
                 alone. From studies in larger flies and other insect species,
                 we hypothesized that the circuitry of the lobula--one of the
                 four, primary neuropiles of the fly optic lobe--performs this
                 visual discrimination. Using calcium imaging of input
                 dendrites, we then show that information encoded in cells
                 projecting from the lobula to discrete optic glomeruli in the

                 coded similar to one another and ``ground-like'' stimuli are
                 encoded differently. One cell class responds to the leading

                 classes cluster any figure-like stimuli, including a figure
                 moving opposite the ground, distinctly from ground alone. This

  author      = "Andretic, Rozi and van Swinderen, Bruno and Greenspan, Ralph J",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Arousal levels in the brain set thresholds for
                 behavior, from simple to complex. The mechanistic
                 underpinnings of the various phenomena comprising arousal,
                 however, are still poorly understood. Drosophila behaviors
                 have been studied that span different levels of arousal, from
                 sleep to visual perception to psychostimulant responses.
                 RESULTS: We have investigated neurobiological mechanisms of
                 arousal in the Drosophila brain by a combined behavioral,
                 genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approach.
                 Administration of methamphetamine (METH) suppresses sleep and
                 promotes active wakefulness, whereas an inhibitor of dopamine
                 synthesis promotes sleep. METH affects courtship behavior by
                 increasing sexual arousal while decreasing successful sexual
                 performance. Electrophysiological recordings from the medial
                 protocerebrum of wild-type flies showed that METH ingestion
                 has rapid and detrimental effects on a brain response
                 associated with perception of visual stimuli. Recordings in
                 genetically manipulated animals show that dopaminergic
                 transmission is required for these responses and that
                 visual-processing deficits caused by attenuated dopaminergic
                 transmission can be rescued by METH. CONCLUSIONS: We show that
                 changes in dopamine levels differentially affect arousal for
                 behaviors of varying complexity. Complex behaviors, such as
                 visual perception, degenerate when dopamine levels are either
                 too high or too low, in accordance with the inverted-U
                 hypothesis of dopamine action in the mammalian brain. Simpler
                 behaviors, such as sleep and locomotion, show graded responses
                 that follow changes in dopamine level.",

  abstract    = "Many of the similarities in visual ecology between the
                 Nematocera and Brachycera and within the Cyclorrhapha may
                 reflect the evolution of blood-feeding in these groups. In
                 Nematocera and Brachycera, blood-feeding is thought to have
                 evolved from predatory or nectar-feeding behavior (138). Only
                 females feed on hosts, and association with hosts generally
                 occurs when hosts are close to the aquatic or semiaquatic
                 habitats of the immatures. Flies feed on nectar, make
                 appetitive flights, disperse, or migrate prior to
                 blood-feeding, and then oviposit in water. Many species are
                 nocturnal or crepuscular. In Cyclorrhapha, flies are closely
                 associated with hosts. They may have arisen from
                 compost-feeding flies that developed a larval dependence on
                 vertebrate-produced microhabitats. Both sexes blood-feed, and
                 mating occurs on or near hosts. Flies generally emerge in the
                 proximity of hosts and maintain close contact with them. These
                 species are diurnal, and their visual systems are well
                 developed. Comparisons between closely related blood-feeding
                 and non-blood-feeding species may provide insight into the
                 visual ecology of blood-feeding species. Despite the different
                 origins of hematophagy, there appears to be a convergence of
                 morphology and behavior that is related to ecology rather than
                 to phylogenetic relationships. This is clearly seen in
                 host-location strategies by tsetse and tabanids. Even within
                 groups such as mosquitoes, species that are active at the same
                 time of day and in the same habitat have more in common than
                 closely related species in different habitats. For this
                 reason, an ecological review would be more cohesive than this
                 phylogenetic discussion. However, because of the
                 disproportionate amount of literature on a small number of
                 groups, the phylogenetic approach is the most practical for
                 this subject. However, this review does point out the great

                 similarities with the ``Hx'' neuron identified in larger

  abstract    = "Flying insects keep their visual system horizontally aligned,
                 suggesting that gaze stabilization is a crucial first step in
                 flight control. Unlike flies, hymenopteran insects such as
                 bees and wasps do not have halteres that provide fast,
                 feed-forward angular rate information to stabilize head
                 orientation in the presence of body rotations. We tested
                 whether hymenopteran insects use inertial (mechanosensory)
                 information to control head orientation from other sources,
                 such as the wings, by applying periodic roll perturbations to
                 male Polistes humilis wasps flying in tether under different
                 visual conditions indoors and in natural outdoor conditions.
                 We oscillated the thorax of the insects with
                 frequency-modulated sinusoids (chirps) with frequencies
                 increasing from 0.2 to 2 Hz at a maximal amplitude of 50 deg
                 peak-to-peak and maximal angular velocity of $\pm$245 deg
                 s(-1). We found that head roll stabilization is best outdoors,
                 but completely absent in uniform visual conditions and in
                 darkness. Step responses confirm that compensatory head roll
                 movements are purely visually driven. Modelling step responses
                 indicates that head roll stabilization is achieved by merging
                 information on head angular velocity, presumably provided by
                 motion-sensitive neurons and information on head orientation,
                 presumably provided by light level integration across the
                 compound eyes and/or ocelli (dorsal light response). Body roll
                 in free flight reaches amplitudes of $\pm$40 deg and angular
                 velocities greater than 1000 deg s(-1), while head orientation
                 remains horizontal for most of the time to within $\pm$10 deg.
                 In free flight, we did not find a delay between spontaneous
                 body roll and compensatory head movements, and suggest that
                 this is evidence for the contribution of a feed-forward
                 control to head stabilization.",

                 terms of how they integrate light stimuli in space and time.
                 These integrative properties, known as the spatiotemporal
                 receptive fields (STRFs), are sometimes obtained using
                 white-noise techniques where a continuous random contrast
                 sequence is delivered to each spatial location within the
                 cell's field of view. In contrast, motion stimuli such as
                 moving bars are usually presented intermittently. Here we
                 compare the STRF prediction of a neuron's response to a moving
                 bar with the measured response in second-order interneurons
                 (L-neurons) of dragonfly ocelli (simple eyes). These
                 low-latency neurons transmit sudden changes in intensity and
                 motion information to mediate flight and gaze stabilization
                 reflexes. A white-noise analysis is made of the responses of
                 L-neurons to random bar stimuli delivered either every frame
                 (densely) or intermittently (sparsely) with a temporal
                 sequence matched to the bar motion stimulus. Linear STRFs
                 estimated using the sparse stimulus were significantly better

                 estimated using a traditional dense white-noise stimulus, even

                 the linear STRF properties of L-neurons in dragonfly ocelli
                 during dense white-noise stimulation. We discuss the ability
                 to predict the responses of visual neurons to arbitrary
                 stimuli based on white-noise analysis. We also discuss the
                 likely functional advantages that adaptive receptive field

  abstract    = "Visual stimuli representing looming or receding objects can be
                 decomposed into four parameters: change in luminance; increase
                 or decrease of area; increase or decrease of object perimeter
                 length; and motion of the object's perimeter or edge. This
                 paper describes intracellular recordings from visual neurons
                 in the optic lobes of Manduca sexta that are selectively
                 activated by certain of these parameters. Two classes of
                 wide-field neurons have been identified that respond
                 selectively to looming and receding stimuli. Class 1 cells
                 respond to parameters of the image other than motion stimuli.
                 They discriminate an approaching or receding disc from an
                 outwardly or inwardly rotating spiral, being activated only by
                 the disc and not by the spiral. Class 2 neurons respond to
                 moving edges. They respond both to movement of the spiral and
                 to an approaching or receding disc. These two classes are
                 further subdivided into neurons that are excited by image
                 expansion (looming) and are inhibited by image contraction
                 (antilooming). Class 2 neurons also respond to horizontal and
                 vertical movement of gratings over the retina. Stimulating
                 class 1 and 2 neurons with white discs against a dark
                 background results in the same activation as stimulation with
                 dark discs against a white background, demonstrating that
                 changes in luminance play no role in the detection of looming
                 or antilooming. The present results show that the two types of
                 looming-sensitive neurons in M. sexta use different mechanisms
                 to detect the approach or retreat of an object. It is proposed
                 that cardinal parameters for this are change of perimeter
                 length detected by class 1 neurons and expansion or
                 contraction visual flow fields detected by class 2 neurons.
                 These two classes also differ with respect to their polarity,
                 the former comprising centripetal cells from the optic lobes
                 to the midbrain, the latter comprising centrifugal neurons

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: For a fruit fly, locating fermenting fruit where
                 it can feed, find mates, and lay eggs is an essential and
                 difficult task requiring the integration of olfactory and
                 visual cues. Here, we develop an approach to correlate flies'
                 free-flight behavior with their olfactory experience under
                 different wind and visual conditions, yielding new insight
                 into plume tracking based on over 70 hr of data. RESULTS: To
                 localize an odor source, flies exhibit three iterative,
                 independent, reflex-driven behaviors, which remain constant
                 through repeated encounters of the same stimulus: (1) 190
                 $\pm$ 75 ms after encountering a plume, flies increase their
                 flight speed and turn upwind, using visual cues to determine
                 wind direction. Due to this substantial response delay, flies
                 pass through the plume shortly after entering it. (2) 450
                 $\pm$ 165 ms after losing the plume, flies initiate a series
                 of vertical and horizontal casts, using visual cues to
                 maintain a crosswind heading. (3) After sensing an attractive
                 odor, flies exhibit an enhanced attraction to small visual
                 features, which increases their probability of finding the
                 plume's source. CONCLUSIONS: Due to plume structure and
                 sensory-motor delays, a fly's olfactory experience during
                 foraging flights consists of short bursts of odor stimulation.
                 As a consequence, delays in the onset of crosswind casting and
                 the increased attraction to visual features are necessary
                 behavioral components for efficiently locating an odor source.
                 Our results provide a quantitative behavioral background for
                 elucidating the neural basis of plume tracking using genetic
                 and physiological approaches.",

  abstract    = "Eyes of the hoverfly Eristalis tenax are sexually dimorphic
                 such that males have a fronto-dorsal region of large facets.
                 In contrast to other large flies in which large facets are
                 associated with a decreased interommatidial angle to form a
                 dorsal ``acute zone'' of increased spatial resolution, we show
                 that a dorsal region of large facets in males appears to form
                 a ``bright zone'' of increased light capture without
                 substantially increased spatial resolution. Theoretically,
                 more light allows for increased performance in tasks such as
                 motion detection. To determine the effect of the bright zone
                 on motion detection, local properties of wide field motion
                 detecting neurons were investigated using localized sinusoidal
                 gratings. The pattern of local preferred directions of one
                 class of these cells, the HS cells, in Eristalis is similar to
                 that reported for the blowfly Calliphora. The bright zone
                 seems to contribute to local contrast sensitivity; high
                 contrast sensitivity exists in portions of the receptive field
                 served by large diameter facet lenses of males and is not
                 observed in females. Finally, temporal frequency tuning is
                 also significantly faster in this frontal portion of the
                 world, particularly in males, where it overcompensates for the
                 higher spatial-frequency tuning and shifts the predicted local
                 velocity optimum to higher speeds. These results indicate that
                 increased retinal illuminance due to the bright zone of males
                 is used to enhance contrast sensitivity and speed motion
                 detector responses. Additionally, local neural properties vary
                 across the visual world in a way not expected if HS cells

                 perturbations is essential for navigating through the world.
                 Visual course control relies on estimating optic flow patterns
                 which, in flies, are encoded by interneurons of the third
                 optic ganglion. However, the rules that translate optic flow
                 into flight motor commands remain poorly understood. Here, we
                 measured the temporal dynamics of optomotor responses in
                 tethered flies to optic flow fields about three cardinal axes.
                 For each condition, we used white noise analysis to determine
                 the optimal linear filters linking optic flow to the sum and
                 difference of left and right wing beat amplitudes. The
                 estimated filters indicate that flies react very quickly to
                 perturbations of the motion field, with pure delays in the
                 order of approximately 20 ms and time-to-peak of approximately
                 100 ms. By convolution the filters also predict responses to
                 arbitrary stimulus sequences, accounting for over half the
                 variance in 5 of our 6 stimulus types, demonstrating the
                 approximate linearity of the system with respect to optic flow
                 variables. In the remaining case of yaw optic flow we improved
                 predictability by measuring individual flies, which also

                 different behavioral states. However, the mechanisms
                 underlying these phenomena remain poorly characterized.
                 RESULTS: We investigated the role of octopamine neurons in the
                 flight-dependent modulation observed in visual interneurons in
                 Drosophila. The vertical system (VS) cells exhibit a boost in
                 their response to visual motion during flight compared to
                 quiescence. Pharmacological application of octopamine evokes
                 responses in quiescent flies that mimic those observed during
                 flight, and octopamine cells that project to the optic lobes

  abstract    = "The discrete and random nature of light absorption dictates
                 that, when photons are scarce, images suffer from low
                 signal-to-noise ratios [1]. Nocturnal animals combat this by
                 increasing photon catch, either optically, with large pupils,
                 photoreceptors, and ever larger eyes [2], or neurally, with
                 summation strategies, which sacrifice acuity and leave images
                 blurry and slow [3]. Fast image motion produces the same
                 problems as dim light: photon noise and low signal-to-noise
                 ratio. As a result, fast animals often exhibit optical
                 adaptations comparable to nocturnal animals, but pronounced in
                 lateral regions of the eye where images move quickly [4]. For
                 example, flying insects typically increase equatorial
                 curvature between the front and side of the eye, which
                 increases interommatidial angle and improves light capture.
                 Drosophila, curiously, show only minor changes in
                 interommatidial angle [5]; but even without optical
                 adaptations, they could potentially achieve a similar effect
                 with neural summation. The optimal strategy would manifest as
                 acuity loss, specifically in regions of fast motion, and only
                 parallel to motion. Photoreceptors need quick temporal
                 dynamics to cope with fast motion [6], so the ideal filtering

                 implement filtering driven by background optic flow, I tested
                 their frequency-dependent steering and found that flow
                 transiently eliminates high spatial frequency responses. This
                 effect increases from forward to lateral visual regions, acts
                 only parallel to flow direction, and filters only high
                 spatial, not temporal, responses. Facultative summation may
                 maximize visual information by improving sensitivity during
                 fast flight, but limiting acuity loss when the fly is still.",

                 Suppression strength depended on when and where the

                 coherent motor actions is poorly understood. In flies, a
                 relatively small set of descending interneurons are
                 responsible for conveying sensory information and higher-order
                 commands from the brain to motor circuits in the ventral nerve
                 cord. Here, we describe three pairs of genetically identified
                 descending interneurons that integrate information from
                 wide-field visual interneurons and project directly to motor
                 centers controlling flight behavior. We measured the
                 physiological responses of these three cells during flight and
                 found that they respond maximally to visual movement
                 corresponding to rotation around three distinct body axes.
                 After characterizing the tuning properties of an array of nine
                 putative upstream visual interneurons, we show that simple
                 linear combinations of their outputs can predict the responses
                 of the three descending cells. Last, we developed a machine
                 vision-tracking system that allows us to monitor multiple

                 descending interneuron class is correlated with a discrete set

                 possess specialized sensory systems for encoding body
                 rotation, which they use for stabilizing posture and
                 regulating motor actions. In flies and other insects, the
                 visual system contains an array of specialized neurons that
                 integrate local optic flow to estimate body rotation during
                 locomotion. However, the manner in which the output of these
                 cells is transformed by the downstream neurons that innervate
                 motor centers is poorly understood. We have identified a set
                 of three visual descending neurons that integrate the output
                 of nine large-field visual interneurons and project directly
                 to flight motor centers. Our results provide new insight into

                 Fortunately, a number of visual landmarks can help them to
                 navigate. In 1910, the United States Congress passed The
                 Height of Buildings Act, limiting the elevation of commercial
                 and residential structures in D.C. to 130 feet. Thus, the
                 555-foot-tall Washington Monument often looms large against
                 the horizon, serving as an anchor point to help set the
                 tourists' sense of direction. Once their heading is set, they
                 can lose sight of the monument behind buildings or groups of
                 tall Scandinavian visitors and still use their internal
                 compass to navigate to the Basin. This compass keeps track of
                 their paces and turns and updates their sense of where they
                 are and where they need to go. Yet while their heading informs

                 been to D.C. in the past can, for example, use remembered

                 and flies have emerged as a powerful model system for
                 exploring this fundamental neural computation. Although
                 numerous studies have suggested that fly motion vision is
                 governed by a simple neural circuit [1-3], the implementation
                 of this circuit has remained mysterious for decades.
                 Connectomics and neurogenetics have produced a surge in recent
                 progress, and several studies have shown selectivity for light
                 increments (ON) or decrements (OFF) in key elements associated
                 with this circuit [4-7]. However, related studies have reached
                 disparate conclusions about where this selectivity emerges and
                 whether it plays a major role in motion vision [8-13]. To
                 address these questions, we examined activity in the neuropil
                 thought to be responsible for visual motion detection, the
                 medulla, of Drosophila melanogaster in response to a range of
                 visual stimuli using two-photon calcium imaging. We confirmed
                 that the input neurons of the medulla, the LMCs, are not
                 responsible for light-on and light-off selectivity. We then
                 examined the pan-neural response of medulla neurons and found
                 prominent selectivity for light-on and light-off in layers of
                 the medulla associated with two anatomically derived pathways
                 (L1/L2 associated) [14, 15]. We next examined the activity of
                 prominent interneurons within each pathway (Mi1 and Tm1) and
                 found that these neurons have corresponding selectivity for
                 light-on or light-off. These results provide direct evidence
                 that motion is computed in parallel light-on and light-off
                 pathways, demonstrate that this selectivity emerges in neurons
                 immediately downstream of the LMCs, and specify where crucial

                 the neuroanatomical identification of two parallel
                 retinotropic subsystems, one supplying descending channels to
                 spectrally independent neck and flight motor circuits, the
                 other supplying polychromatic channels to neuropils associated
                 with leg motor circuits in the thoracic ganglia. In the
                 compound eye, two classes of photoreceptors contribute to each
                 of several thousand sampling units. High-sensitivity,
                 chromatically uniform short-axon photoreceptors (R1-R6) supply
                 the lamina's external plexiform layer and are presynaptic to
                 L1, L2 efferents. These project in parallel with a second
                 system of trichromatic long-axon receptors and the L3
                 efferent. Both pathways supply columns of the medulla, equal
                 in number to ommatidia. Golgi and cobalt-silver impregnation
                 demonstrates that neurons from the medulla diverge to two
                 deeper regions, the lobula plate and lobula, the former a thin
                 tectum of neuropil dorsal to the more substantial lobula.
                 Layer relationships between medulla neurons and their afferent
                 supply suggest that the lobula plate and lobula are each
                 supplied by one or the other, but not both, of the two
                 parallel subsystems. Independence of the two parallel pathways
                 is suggested by ablation of the photoreceptor layer leading to
                 selective degeneration of the motion-sensitive lobula plate
                 neuropil. In addition, octets of small-field neurons
                 associated with the R1-R6/L1, L2 pathway give rise to synaptic
                 complexes with motion-sensitive neurons of the lobula plate. A

                 in both animals and engineered vehicles. For example, a common
                 strategy for moving along a straight path is to turn such that
                 the measured rate of rotation is zero. This task can be
                 accomplished by using a feedback signal that is proportional
                 to the instantaneous value of the measured sensory signal. In
                 such a system, the addition of an integral term depending on
                 past values of the sensory input is needed to eliminate
                 steady-state error [proportional-integral (PI) control].
                 However, the means by which nervous systems implement such a
                 computation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the
                 optomotor responses of flying Drosophila follow a time course
                 consistent with temporal integration of horizontal motion
                 input. To investigate the cellular basis of this effect, we
                 performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the set of
                 identified visual interneurons [horizontal system (HS) cells]
                 thought to control this reflex during tethered flight. At high
                 stimulus speeds, HS cells exhibit steady-state responses
                 during flight that are absent during quiescence, a
                 state-dependent difference in physiology that is explained by
                 changes in their presynaptic inputs. However, even during
                 flight, the membrane potential of the large-field interneurons
                 exhibits no evidence for integration that could explain the
                 behavioral responses. However, using a genetically encoded
                 indicator, we found that calcium accumulates in the terminals
                 of the interneurons along a time course consistent with the
                 behavior and propose that this accumulation provides a
                 mechanism for temporal integration of sensory feedback

  abstract    = "Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual
                 landmarks to orient in their environment. In Drosophila
                 melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a
                 higher brain structure called the central complex as being
                 required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual
                 features and its short- and long-term memory for visual
                 patterns. But whether and how neurons of the fly central
                 complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use
                 two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying
                 flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons--a class
                 of central complex neurons that have been implicated in
                 landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies and memory for
                 visual patterns in tethered flying flies. We show that
                 dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged
                 retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both
                 excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of
                 simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring
                 neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective
                 orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically
                 oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses
                 in flies. Visual responses were diminished during flight, but,
                 in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex
                 in the control of locomotion, not modulated during walking.
                 Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons
                 represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's
                 environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to
                 produce appropriate motor commands. More broadly, this study
                 opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit
                 computations underlying visually guided action selection in

                 about its long axis when presented with a visual stimulus
                 consisting of a rotating radial grating. This roll response is
                 isometrically measured as a torque (Fig. 2). 2. Comparison of
                 the dynamic characteristics of the roll response with those of
                 the classical optomotor response reveals that similar neuronal
                 mechanisms mediate visual stabilization of roll and yaw
                 motions. 3. The changes of wingbeat amplitude that are
                 elicited by a rotating radial grating are photographically
                 measured and compared to those elicited by a
                 vertically-moving, linear grating (Fig. 4). This data reveals
                 that the flight mechanism generates a roll torque by creating
                 an asymmetry in the lift-forces produced by the two wings. 4.
                 The manner in which a fly detects and responds to roll is
                 consistent with a scheme in which the lift produced by a given

                 the ipsilateral eye (Table 1). 5. Under closed-loop conditions

                 poorly understood. We recently identified two MB output neuron
                 (MBON) classes whose axons convey sleep control signals from
                 the MB to converge in the same downstream target region: a
                 cholinergic sleep-promoting MBON class and a glutamatergic

                 neurogenetic, behavioral, and physiological approaches to
                 identify and mechanistically dissect sleep-controlling
                 circuits of the MB. Our studies reveal the existence of two

                 intrinsic MB ``Kenyon cells'' (KCs) to specific

                 information is acquired and processed to guide locomotion and
                 navigation. Flies maintain a straight course and monitor their
                 motion through the environment by sensing the patterns of
                 optic flow induced in the eyes. Bees negotiate narrow gaps by
                 balancing the speeds of the images in their two eyes, and they
                 control flight speed by holding constant the average image
                 velocity as seen with their two eyes. Bees achieve a smooth
                 landing on a horizontal surface by holding the image velocity
                 of the surface constant during approach, thus ensuring that

                 shown which cells constitute their major presynaptic elements.
                 LPTCs are supposed to be rendered directionally selective by
                 integrating excitatory as well as inhibitory input from many
                 local motion detectors. Based on their stratification in the
                 different layers of the lobula plate, the columnar cells T4

                 Flapping wings with suitable wing kinematics, wing shapes, and
                 flexible structures can enhance lift as well as thrust by
                 exploiting large-scale vortical flow structures under various
                 conditions. However, the scaling invariance of both fluid
                 dynamics and structural dynamics as the size changes is
                 fundamentally difficult. The focus of this review is to assess
                 the recent progress in flapping wing aerodynamics and
                 aeroelasticity. It is realized that a variation of the
                 Reynolds number (wing sizing, flapping frequency, etc.) leads
                 to a change in the leading edge vortex (LEV) and spanwise flow
                 structures, which impacts the aerodynamic force generation.
                 While in classical stationary wing theory, the tip vortices
                 (TiVs) are seen as wasted energy, in flapping flight, they can
                 interact with the LEV to enhance lift without increasing the
                 power requirements. Surrogate modeling techniques can assess
                 the aerodynamic outcomes between two- and three-dimensional
                 wing. The combined effect of the TiVs, the LEV, and jet can
                 improve the aerodynamics of a flapping wing. Regarding
                 aeroelasticity, chordwise flexibility in the forward flight
                 can substantially adjust the projected area normal to the
                 flight trajectory via shape deformation, hence redistributing
                 thrust and lift. Spanwise flexibility in the forward flight
                 creates shape deformation from the wing root to the wing tip
                 resulting in varied phase shift and effective angle of attack

                 sensory organs, the compound eyes and mechanosensory hindwings
                 called halteres, are capable of encoding angular velocity of
                 the body during flight. Although motor reflexes driven by the
                 two modalities have been studied individually, little is known
                 about how the two sensory feedback channels are integrated

  abstract    = "To navigate through the world, animals must stabilize their
                 path against disturbances and change direction to avoid
                 obstacles and to search for resources [1, 2]. Locomotion is
                 thus guided by sensory cues but also depends on intrinsic
                 processes, such as motivation and physiological state. Flies,
                 for example, turn with the direction of large-field rotatory
                 motion, an optomotor reflex that is thought to help them fly
                 straight [3-5]. Occasionally, however, they execute fast
                 turns, called body saccades, either spontaneously or in
                 response to patterns of visual motion such as expansion [6-8].
                 These turns can be measured in tethered flying Drosophila [3,
                 4, 9], which facilitates the study of underlying neural
                 mechanisms. Whereas there is evidence for an efference copy
                 input to visual interneurons during saccades [10], the
                 circuits that control spontaneous and visually elicited
                 saccades are not well known. Using two-photon calcium imaging
                 and electrophysiological recordings in tethered flying
                 Drosophila, we have identified a descending neuron whose
                 activity is correlated with both spontaneous and visually
                 elicited turns during tethered flight. The cell's activity in
                 open- and closed-loop experiments suggests that it does not
                 underlie slower compensatory responses to horizontal motion
                 but rather controls rapid changes in flight path. The activity
                 of this neuron can explain some of the behavioral variability
                 observed in response to visual motion and appears sufficient
                 for eliciting turns when artificially activated. This work
                 provides an entry point into studying the circuits underlying
                 the control of rapid steering maneuvers in the fly brain.",

                 two-winged insects such as houseflies and their relatives, the
                 hind wings are modified into club-shaped, mechanosensory
                 halteres, which detect Coriolis forces and thereby mediate
                 flight stability during maneuvers. Here, we show that
                 mechanosensory input from the antennae serves a similar role

                 The antennae of flying moths vibrate and experience Coriolis
                 forces during aerial maneuvers. The antennal vibrations are
                 transduced by individual units of Johnston's organs at the
                 base of their antennae in a frequency range characteristic of
                 the Coriolis input. Reduction of the mechanical input to
                 Johnston's organs by removing the antennal flagellum of these

  abstract    = "Motion estimation is crucial for aerial animals such as the
                 fly, which perform fast and complex maneuvers while flying
                 through a 3-D environment. Motion-sensitive neurons in the
                 lobula plate, a part of the visual brain, of the fly have been
                 studied extensively for their specialized role in motion
                 encoding. However, the visual stimuli used in such studies are
                 typically highly simplified, often move in restricted ways,
                 and do not represent the complexities of optic flow generated
                 during actual flight. Here, we use combined rotations about
                 different axes to study how H1, a wide-field motion-sensitive
                 neuron, encodes preferred yaw motion in the presence of
                 stimuli not aligned with its preferred direction. Our approach
                 is an extension of ``white noise'' methods, providing a
                 framework that is readily adaptable to quantitative studies
                 into the coding of mixed dynamic stimuli in other systems. We
                 find that the presence of a roll or pitch (``distractor'')
                 stimulus reduces information transmitted by H1 about yaw, with
                 the amount of this reduction depending on the variance of the
                 distractor. Spike generation is influenced by features of both
                 yaw and the distractor, where the degree of influence is
                 determined by their relative strengths. Certain distractor
                 features may induce bidirectional responses, which are
                 indicative of an imbalance between global excitation and
                 inhibition resulting from complex optic flow. Further, the
                 response is shaped by the dynamics of the combined stimulus.
                 Our results provide intuition for plausible strategies

                 to map out and actively explore our surroundings. However, we
                 view the world from a constantly shifting platform and some
                 visual mechanisms function optimally only if the images on the
                 retina are reasonably steady. As we go about our everyday
                 activities, visual and vestibular mechanisms help to stabilize
                 our gaze on particular objects of interest by generating eye
                 movements to offset our head movements. The general picture
                 that has emerged of gaze stabilization in primates during
                 motion is of two vestibulo-ocular reflexes, the RVOR and TVOR,
                 that compensate selectively for rotational and translational
                 disturbances of the head, respectively, each with its own
                 independent visual backup mechanisms. A major objective of
                 this chapter is to review recent work on low-level,
                 pre-attentive mechanisms that operate with ultra-short
                 latencies and are largely independent of conscious perception.
                 Recent advances in the field of robotics and, particularly, in
                 the domain of active vision, provide a complementary view of
                 the uses and associated problems of visuo-inertial integration
                 for the stabilization of gaze. Much like biological systems,
                 robots have to comply with physical constraints imposed by the
                 environment and/or by the need to coordinate their
                 sensori-motor components in an efficient way. In contrast with
                 biological systems, however, the experimental variation of
                 implementation parameters and control strategies allows, among
                 other things, a comparison of the different hypotheses and
                 implementations. The goal of this chapter is to draw parallels
                 between the results from biology and from a robot which uses
                 inertial and visual information to stabilize its cameras/eyes.

                 peculiarities of the patterns of retinal motion (optic flow)
                 experienced by an observer moving through the environment. The
                 appropriate compensatory eye movements required to stabilize
                 gaze are described in Section 3, introducing the distinction
                 between vergence and version eye movements. Section 4
                 describes the main characteristics of the vestibular system
                 from a biological and artificial perspective and the
                 distinction between ``rotational'' and ``translational''
                 components of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The magnitude
                 of the eye movements required for complete compensation
                 depends on various kinematic parameters such as the position
                 of the eyes in the head, the inter-ocular distance, as well as
                 the distance to the fixation point. Section 5 deals with the
                 integration of visual and inertial information for gaze
                 stabilization. This Section builds upon the concept of
                 ``translational'' and ``rotational'' components of the VOR and
                 highlights the differences between ``version'' and
                 ``vergence'' control of compensatory eye movements. In
                 particular the role of the radial component of optical flow in
                 the feed-forward control of eye movements is compared with the
                 feed-back loop mediated by binocular disparity. In Section 6,
                 the contribution of inertial and visual information in gaze
                 stabilization is discussed with reference to the different
                 latencies and processing power required by the two modalities.
                 The advantage of the integration of visual and inertial data
                 is discussed from a biological and robotics perspective in the
                 concluding Section.",

                 Three-dimensional organization of compensatory reactions to
                 real and simulated rotations",
  author      = "Nalbach, Gerbera and Hengstenberg, R",
  abstract    = "We quantitatively analysed compensatory head reactions of
                 flies to imposed body rotations in yaw, pitch and roll and
                 characterized the haltere as a sense organ for maintaining
                 equilibrium. During constant velocity rotation, the head first
                 moves to compensate retinal slip and then attains a plateau
                 excursion (Fig. 3). Below 500°/s, initial head velocity as
                 well as final excursion depend linearily on stimulus
                 velocities for all three axes. Head saccades occur rarely and
                 are synchronous to wing beat saccades (Fig. 5). They are
                 interpreted as spontaneous actions superposed to the
                 compensatory reaction and are thus not resetting movements
                 like the fast phase of `vestibulo-ocular' nystagmus in
                 vertebrates. In addition to subjecting the flies to actual
                 body rotations we developed a method to mimick rotational
                 stimuli by subjecting the body of a flying fly to vibrations
                 (1 to 200 $\mu$m, 130 to 150 Hz), which were coupled on line
                 to the fly's haltere beat. The reactions to simulated Coriolis
                 forces, mimicking a rotation with constant velocity, are
                 qualitatively and to a large extent also quantitatively
                 identical to the reactions to real rotations (Figs. 3, 7--9).
                 Responses to roll- and pitch stimuli are co-axial. During yaw
                 stimulation (halteres and visual) the head performs both a yaw
                 and a roll reaction (Fig. 3e,f), thus reacting not co-axial.
                 This is not due to mechanical constraints of the neck
                 articulation, but rather it is interpreted as an `advance
                 compensation' of a banked body position during free flight yaw
                 turns (Fig. 10).",

                 stable gaze by driving the neck motor system using information
                 from different sensors. Our model explicitly considers
                 inherent constraints in biological systems, i.e. the ambiguity
                 and noisiness of sensor signals and inevitable response delays
                 in sensory information processing, and limited energy supply
                 for the neck motor system. The proposed model consists of a
                 state estimator with Kalman filtering and a controller with
                 infinite-horizon dynamic programming that minimises the costs
                 associated with muscle contraction, together with the costs
                 for the fly to be in an imperfectly stabilised state.
                 Closed-loop simulations of the proposed model confirm that our

                 classified in 3 groups (one group contains the previously
                 described LGMD neurone). Neurones of Group 1 have extensive
                 ramifications in the medulla and lobula, as well as in the
                 brain. One neurone of Group 1 projects to the lamina. The cell
                 bodies lie in the protocerebrum contralateral to the optic
                 lobe projections. Group 2 neurones have a dendritic fan within
                 the lobula, and processes in the ipsilateral protocerebrum.
                 Their cell bodies lie in the lobula. This group contains the
                 LGMD neurone. Neurones of Group 3 have processes in the
                 lobula, optic stalk and in one or both protocerebra. Their
                 cell bodies are located at the border of the optic lobe and
                 the protocerebrum. 2. Movement in any direction excites the
                 neurones. Some are binocularly driven. Small-field stimuli
                 elicit greater excitation than do large-field stimuli. If a
                 stimulus is presented repeatedly the response wanes rapidly.
                 In some of the neurones, the response to light ON or to light
                 OFF consists of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic
                 potentials. No evidence could be found that the 6 neurones are
                 linked synaptically to one another, although all of them

                 light ON or OFF.",

                 behavioural analysis of the dipteran haltere system",

  abstract    = "Flies acquire information about self-rotation via Coriolis
                 forces detected by their moving halteres. Information
                 processing in the haltere system was analysed by exploiting
                 the method of simulating rotational stimuli by vibrating the
                 fly's body and simultaneously observing compensatory head and
                 wing reactions. Although the force acting on one haltere
                 contains Coriolis terms for rotations about three orthogonal
                 axes, the one-haltered fly has only two measuring axes which
                 are coded in lateral force components. A fly with two halteres
                 has two vertical measuring axes and two horizontal axes, the
                 latter spanning an angle of about 120 degrees. Thus,
                 three-dimensional turning information is acquired by bilateral
                 computation in a highly non-orthogonal system. In the stimulus
                 velocity range up to 1000 degrees/s, comparison of intact and
                 one-haltered flies demonstrates that for the head roll
                 reaction the inputs from both halteres are summated, whereas
                 for the pitch reaction the summated inputs are modified by
                 bilateral inhibition. This non-linear operation results in
                 uniform gains and axis fidelity for all stimulus directions in
                 the case of the head reaction. Response saturation at high
                 velocities takes place after the bilateral summation. The

                 haltere system is apparently superior sensitivity for pitch
                 compared to roll. Minimization of the ``area of confusion'',
                 an argument for orthogonality, seems to be of minor
                 importance. The non-orthogonality necessitates a
                 transformation from covariant projections to contravariant
                 motor components. In tensor theory of the vestibulo-ocular
                 reflex of vertebrates, this is widely assumed to be a linear
                 operation performed by a metric tensor. The fly's solution is
                 a linear tensor operation supplemented by a non-linear
                 bilateral inhibition for the pitch reaction.",

                 studying the neural segregation and integration of visual
                 information. Vision in honeybees has been extensively studied
                 at the behavioral level and, to a lesser degree, at the
                 physiological level using intracellular electrophysiological
                 recordings of single neurons. However, our knowledge of visual
                 processing in honeybees is still limited by the lack of
                 functional studies of visual processing at the circuit level.
                 Here we contribute to filling this gap by providing a
                 neuroanatomical and neurophysiological characterization at the
                 circuit level of a practically unstudied visual area of the
                 bee brain, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu). First, we
                 analyzed the internal organization and neuronal connections of
                 the AOTu. Second, we established a novel protocol for
                 performing optophysiological recordings of visual circuit
                 activity in the honeybee brain and studied the responses of
                 AOTu interneurons during stimulation of distinct eye regions.
                 Our neuroanatomical data show an intricate
                 compartmentalization and connectivity of the AOTu, revealing a
                 dorsoventral segregation of the visual input to the AOTu.
                 Light stimuli presented in different parts of the visual field
                 (dorsal, lateral, or ventral) induce distinct patterns of
                 activation in AOTu output interneurons, retaining to some
                 extent the dorsoventral input segregation revealed by our
                 neuroanatomical data. In particular, activity patterns evoked
                 by dorsal and ventral eye stimulation are clearly segregated
                 into distinct AOTu subunits. Our results therefore suggest an
                 involvement of the AOTu in the processing of dorsoventrally
                 segregated visual information in the honeybee brain.",

                 common task for animals searching for prey or conspecifics, a
                 task made even more difficult when a moving pursuer needs to
                 analyze targets against the motion of background texture
                 (clutter). Despite the limited optical acuity of the compound
                 eye of insects, this challenging task seems to have been
                 solved by their tiny visual system. Here we describe neurons
                 found in the male hoverfly, Eristalis tenax, that respond
                 selectively to small moving targets. Although many of these
                 target neurons are inhibited by the motion of a background
                 pattern, others respond to target motion within the receptive
                 field under a surprisingly large range of background motion
                 stimuli. Some neurons respond whether or not there is a speed
                 differential between target and background. Analysis of
                 responses to very small targets (smaller than the size of the
                 visual field of single photoreceptors) or those targets with
                 reduced contrast shows that these neurons have extraordinarily
                 high contrast sensitivity. Our data suggest that rejection of
                 background motion may result from extreme selectivity for
                 small targets contrasting against local patches of the
                 background, combined with this high sensitivity, such that

                 selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding
                 multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns
                 of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to
                 behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at

                 a target be stored, especially in case the target moves out of
                 sight. The capability to retain, recall and integrate such
                 positional information into guiding behaviour has been
                 summarized under the term spatial working memory. This kind of
                 memory contains specific details of the presence that are not
                 necessarily part of a long-term memory. Neurophysiological
                 studies in primates indicate that sustained activity of
                 neurons encodes the sensory information even though the object
                 is no longer present. Furthermore they suggest that dopamine
                 transmits the respective input to the prefrontal cortex, and
                 simultaneous suppression by GABA spatially restricts this
                 neuronal activity. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster
                 possesses a similar spatial memory during locomotion. Using a
                 new detour setup, we show that flies can remember the position
                 of an object for several seconds after it has been removed
                 from their environment. In this setup, flies are temporarily
                 lured away from the direction towards their hidden target, yet
                 they are thereafter able to aim for their former target.
                 Furthermore, we find that the GABAergic (stainable with
                 antibodies against GABA) ring neurons of the ellipsoid body in
                 the central brain are necessary and their plasticity is
                 sufficient for a functional spatial orientation memory in
                 flies. We also find that the protein kinase S6KII (ignorant)
                 is required in a distinct subset of ring neurons to display
                 this memory. Conditional expression of S6KII in these neurons
                 only in adults can restore the loss of the orientation memory
                 of the ignorant mutant. The S6KII signalling pathway therefore
                 seems to be acutely required in the ring neurons for spatial
                 orientation memory in flies.",

                 compensatory motion of the sophisticated avian head-neck
                 system. While relative head motion has been studied in
                 stationary and walking birds, little is known about how birds
                 accomplish head stabilization during flapping flight. To
                 unravel this, we approximate the avian neck with a linear
                 mass-spring-damper system for vertical displacements,
                 analogous to proven head stabilization models for walking

                 accumulation in lobula plate tangential cells of the fly
                 visual system using an in vitro preparation of the fly brain.
                 Local visual stimulation evokes a localized calcium signal in
                 the dendrites of these cells in vivo. Here we show that a
                 similar localized calcium accumulation can be elicited in
                 vitro by focal iontophoretic application of the cholinergic
                 agonist carbachol. The calcium signal had at least two
                 sources: first, voltage-dependent calcium channels contributed
                 to the carbachol-induced signal and were concentrated on the
                 dendrite, the soma, and the terminal ramification of the axon.
                 However, the dendritic calcium signal induced by carbachol
                 stimulation was only weakly dependent on membrane
                 depolarization. The most likely explanation for the second,
                 voltage-independent part of the dendritic calcium signal is
                 calcium entry through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We
                 found no indication of second-messenger or calcium-mediated
                 calcium release from intracellular stores. In summary, the

                 mysterious, although it is increasingly evident that even
                 animals with the smallest brains display this capacity. For
                 example, insects respond selectively to salient visual

                 When extending an arm to reach for an object, the brain uses
                 predictive models of both limb dynamics and target properties.
                 Whether invertebrates use such models remains unclear. Here we
                 examine to what extent prey interception by dragonflies
                 (Plathemis lydia), a behaviour analogous to targeted reaching,
                 requires internal models. By simultaneously tracking the
                 position and orientation of a dragonfly's head and body during
                 flight, we provide evidence that interception steering is
                 driven by forward and inverse models of dragonfly body
                 dynamics and by models of prey motion. Predictive rotations of
                 the dragonfly's head continuously track the prey's angular
                 position. The head-body angles established by prey tracking
                 appear to guide systematic rotations of the dragonfly's body
                 to align it with the prey's flight path. Model-driven control
                 thus underlies the bulk of interception steering manoeuvres,
                 while vision is used for reactions to unexpected prey
                 movements. These findings illuminate the computational

                 identified so far. It is, however, known that L2 contacts,
                 among others, two neurons, called Tm2 and L4, which show a
                 pronounced directionality in their wiring. RESULTS: We
                 characterized the visual response properties of both Tm2 and
                 L4 neurons via Ca(2+) imaging. We found that Tm2 and L4 cells
                 respond with an increase in activity to moving OFF edges in a
                 direction-unselective manner. To investigate their
                 participation in motion vision, we blocked their output while
                 recording from downstream tangential cells in the lobula
                 plate. Silencing of Tm2 and L4 completely abolishes the
                 response to moving OFF edges. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
                 demonstrate that both cell types are essential components of
                 the Drosophila OFF motion vision pathway, prior to the
                 computation of directionality in the dendrites of T5 cells.",

                 erythrocephala L. mainly during tethered flight in a
                 wind-tunnel, to study its movements about the longitudinal
                 body axis (roll). During undisturbed flight, flies hold their
                 head on average aligned with the body but may turn it about
                 all three body axes. Pitch and yaw turns of the head are
                 comparatively small (20 degrees), whereas roll turns can be
                 large (90 degrees), and fast (1200 degrees s-1). When
                 passively rolled, flies produce compensatory head movements
                 during walking or flight; at rest this reflex is turned off.
                 Flies perceive a static misalignment relative to the vertical,
                 as well as roll motion up to 10 000 degrees s-1. Within this
                 range flies counteract an imposed roll with maximal gain at
                 about 1000 degrees s-1. Compensatory head movements are made
                 with very low latency (down to $\Delta$ t $\approx$ 5 ms), and
                 with considerable speed (up to $\omega$ = 1000 degrees s-1).
                 Flies may `disregard an apparent deviation from their correct
                 orientation, and may superimpose spontaneous head movements on
                 those elicited by a stimulus. Compensatory head movements
                 generally undercompensate the imposed misalignment.
                 Simultaneously, however, flies modify their wing pitch and
                 wingbeat amplitude to produce a compensatory roll torque.
                 Since head and body roll act simultaneously and in the same
                 direction, the overall speed and degree of head realignment,
                 relative to external coordinates, increase considerably. This
                 is certainly an advantage for flight in turbulent air. In
                 still air, without need to correct an imposed misalignment,
                 flies nevertheless produce spontaneous fluctuations of their
                 flight torque, and head roll movements in the opposite
                 direction. This is to be expected if flies intend to keep
                 their eyes aligned with the coordinates of the environment
                 while spontaneously performing banked turns. The limits of fly
                 vision and the advantages of compensatory head movements for
                 different visually guided behaviour are discussed.
                 Compensatory head roll movements give flies greater
                 manoeuvrability when cruising than the visual system would
                 allow, without such a stabilizing reflex.",

                 experienced by blowflies in a three-dimensional environment.
                 This optic flow is largely shaped by the blowfly's saccadic
                 flight and gaze strategy, which separates translational flight
                 segments from fast saccadic rotations. By modifying this
                 naturalistic optic flow, all three analyzed neurons could be
                 shown to respond during the intersaccadic intervals not only
                 to nearby objects but also to changes in the distance to
                 background structures. In the presence of strong background
                 motion, the three types of neuron differ in their sensitivity
                 for object motion. Object-induced response increments are
                 largest in FD1, a neuron long known to respond better to
                 moving objects than to spatially extended motion patterns, but
                 weakest in VCH, a neuron that integrates wide-field motion
                 from both eyes and, by inhibiting the FD1 cell, is responsible
                 for its object preference. Small but significant
                 object-induced response increments are present in HS cells,
                 which serve both as a major input neuron of VCH and as output

                 intersaccadic background responses decrease with increasing
                 distance to the animal, although much more prominently in FD1.
                 This strong dependence of FD1 on background distance is
                 concluded to be the consequence of the activity of VCH that

                 humans, and so far they have been associated with retention of
                 previously acquired awake experience. Although hippocampal
                 ripples have been studied in detail using neurophysiological
                 methods, the global effects of ripples on the entire brain
                 remain elusive, primarily owing to a lack of methodologies
                 permitting concurrent hippocampal recordings and whole-brain
                 activity mapping. By combining electrophysiological recordings
                 in hippocampus with ripple-triggered functional magnetic
                 resonance imaging, here we show that most of the cerebral
                 cortex is selectively activated during the ripples, whereas
                 most diencephalic, midbrain and brainstem regions are strongly

                 temporally bounded by massive activations of association and

                 activity may be orchestrating a privileged interaction state
                 between hippocampus and cortex by silencing the output of
                 subcortical centres involved in sensory processing or

                 on the eyes during locomotion is an important source of
                 information about self-motion and the structure of the
                 environment. The blowfly has been used frequently as a model
                 system for experimental analysis of optic flow processing at
                 the microcircuit level. Here, we describe a model of the
                 computational mechanisms implemented by these circuits in the
                 blowfly motion vision pathway. Although this model was
                 originally proposed based on simple experimenter-designed
                 stimuli, we show that it is also capable to quantitatively
                 predict the responses to the complex dynamic stimuli a blowfly
                 encounters in free flight. In particular, the model visual
                 system exploits the active saccadic gaze and flight strategy
                 of blowflies in a similar way, as does its neuronal
                 counterpart. The model circuit extracts information about

                 indirectly, about the three-dimensional layout of the

                 determine which of its components are essential for these

                 complex natural stimuli, the model is much more robust against
                 parameter changes than when explaining the neuronal responses
                 to simple experimenter-defined stimuli. In contrast to

                 neuroblasts. We demonstrate that the lineage principle guides
                 the connectivity and function of neurons, providing input to
                 the central complex, a collection of neuropil compartments
                 important for visually guided behaviors. One of these
                 compartments is the ellipsoid body (EB), a structure formed
                 largely by the axons of ring (R) neurons, all of which are
                 generated by a single lineage, DALv2. Two further lineages,
                 DALcl1 and DALcl2, produce neurons that connect the anterior
                 optic tubercle, a central brain visual center, with R neurons.
                 Finally, DALcl1/2 receive input from visual projection neurons
                 of the optic lobe medulla, completing a three-legged circuit
                 that we call the anterior visual pathway (AVP). The AVP bears
                 a fundamental resemblance to the sky-compass pathway, a visual
                 navigation circuit described in other insects. Neuroanatomical
                 analysis and two-photon calcium imaging demonstrate that
                 DALcl1 and DALcl2 form two parallel channels, establishing
                 connections with R neurons located in the peripheral and
                 central domains of the EB, respectively. Although neurons of

                 receptive fields, whereas DALcl2 neurons share a large
                 excitatory receptive field in the contralateral hemifield.
                 DALcl2 neurons become inhibited when the object enters the
                 ipsilateral hemifield and display an additional excitation
                 after the object leaves the field of view. Thus, the spatial

                 capacity, the flight muscles can sustain a mechanical power
                 output of nearly 80 W kg-1 muscle mass at 24 degrees C, which
                 is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150\% of the
                 animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that
                 required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in
                 wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke
                 amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs,
                 although greater than either profile or induced power, would
                 be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and
                 total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to
                 aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag

                 approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force

  abstract    = "Compound eyes are typically composed of hundreds to thousands
                 of ommatidia, each containing 8-10 receptors. The maximal
                 spatial frequency at which a compound eye can sample the
                 environment is determined by the inter-ommatidial angle. Males
                 of the insect order Strepsiptera are different: their eyes are
                 composed of a smaller number of relatively large units
                 (eyelets), each with an extended retina. Building on a study
                 of Xenos vesparum, we use a behavioral paradigm based on the
                 optomotor response to investigate the possibility that the
                 eyelets of the Strepsiptera Xenos peckii are image-forming
                 units. From anatomical evidence, we hypothesize that spatial
                 sampling in the strepsipteran eye is determined not only by
                 the interactions of widely spaced photoreceptors in different
                 eyelets, but also by the angular separation between groups of
                 closely spaced photoreceptors within eyelets. We compared X.
                 peckii's optomotor response with the predictions of an
                 elementary motion detector (EMD) model consisting of two
                 distinctly different sampling bases. The best match between
                 our empirical results and the model shows that the optomotor
                 response in X. peckii males is determined by both the small
                 (intra-eyelet) and large (possibly inter-eyelet) separations.
                 Our results indicate that the X. peckii eye has sampling bases
                 around 10 degrees and 20 degrees , and that each eyelet could
                 be composed of up to 13 sampling points, which is consistent
                 with previous anatomical findings. This study is the first to
                 use the EMD model explicitly to investigate the possibility
                 that strepsipteran eyes combine motion detection features from
                 both camera and compound eyes.",

                 (GRASP) method to probe connections between the chromatic Tm

  abstract    = "The patterns of eye movement that accompany static activities
                 such as reading have been studied since the early 1900s, but
                 it is only since head-mounted eye trackers became available in
                 the 1980s that it has been possible to study active tasks such
                 as walking, driving, playing ball games and ordinary everyday
                 activities like food preparation. This review examines the
                 ways that vision contributes to the organization of such
                 activities, and in particular how eye movements are used to
                 locate the information needed by the motor system in the
                 execution of each act. Major conclusions are that the eyes are
                 proactive, typically seeking out the information required in
                 the second before each act commences, although occasional
                 'look ahead' fixations are made to establish the locations of
                 objects for use further into the future. Gaze often moves on
                 before the last act is complete, indicating the presence of an
                 information buffer. Each task has a characteristic but
                 flexible pattern of eye movements that accompanies it, and
                 this pattern is similar between individuals. The eyes rarely
                 visit objects that are irrelevant to the action, and the
                 conspicuity of objects (in terms of low-level image
                 statistics) is much less important than their role in the
                 task. Gaze control may involve movements of eyes, head and
                 trunk, and these are coordinated in a way that allows for both
                 flexibility of movement and stability of gaze. During the
                 learning of a new activity, the eyes first provide feedback on
                 the motor performance, but as this is perfected they provide
                 feed-forward direction, seeking out the next object to be

                 environments is a challenging task because these artificial
                 creatures have small aeromechanical time constants, which make
                 them prone to be disturbed by gusts of wind. Flying insects
                 are subject to quite similar kinds of disturbances, yet they
                 navigate swiftly and deftly. Flying insects display high-
                 performance visuo-motor control systems that have stood the
                 test of time. They can therefore teach us how vision can be
                 used for immediate and vital actions. We built a 50-gram
                 tethered aerial demonstrator, called OSCAR II, which manages
                 to keep its gaze steadily fixating a target (a dark edge), in
                 spite of nasty thumps that we deliberately gave to its body
                 with a custom-made ``slapping machine''. The robot's agile yaw
                 reactions are based on: (1) a mechanical decoupling of the eye
                 from the body, (2) an active coupling of the robot's heading
                 with its gaze, (3) a Visual Fixation Reflex (VFR), (4) a
                 Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), (5) an accurate and fast
                 actuator (voice coil motor, VCM). The actuator is a 2.4-gram
                 voice coil motor that is able to rotate the eye with a rise
                 time as small as 12 ms, that is, much shorter than the rise
                 time of human oculo-motor saccades. In connection with a
                 micro-rate gyro, this actuator endows the robot with a high
                 performance ``vestibulo ocular reflex'' that keeps the gaze
                 locked onto the target whatever perturbations in yaw affect
                 the robot's body. Whenever the robot is destabilized (e.g., by
                 a slap applied on one side), the gaze keeps fixating the
                 target, while being the reference to which the robot's heading
                 is servoed. It then takes the robot only 0.6 s to realign its
                 heading with its gaze.",

  abstract    = "1. From a comparison of the photoresponses and membrane
                 properties of photoreceptors from 20 species of Diptera, we
                 conclude that coding in the time domain is matched to the
                 dictates of visual ecology. This matching involves the
                 dynamics of phototransduction and the use of an appropriate
                 mix of potassium conductances to tune the photoreceptor
                 membrane. 2. Rapidly flying, manoeuvrable diurnal Diptera from
                 several families have fast photoreceptors, with corner
                 frequencies (the frequency at which signal power falls by a
                 half) of between 50 and 107 Hz. The ponderous and
                 predominantly nocturnal tipulids have slow photoreceptors with
                 fully light adapted corner frequencies of 16 to 19 Hz. 3. Dark
                 adapted fast photoreceptors have a lower gain (as indicated by
                 lower noise levels), a lower sensitivity, and light adapt more
                 rapidly than dark adapted slow photoreceptors. Fast cells also
                 have much lower input resistances and shorter time constants.
                 4. Fast photoreceptors rectify more strongly in the steady
                 state because of a weakly inactivating delayed rectifier
                 potassium conductance with fast and slow components of
                 activation. Slow photoreceptors rectify less strongly in the
                 steady state because their membrane properties are dominated
                 by strongly inactivating outward currents with reversal
                 potentials in the range --- 80 to -90 mV. 5. The differences
                 between potassium conductances match the differing functional
                 requirements of fast and slow photoreceptors. The
                 non-inactivating delayed rectifier promotes the rapid response
                 of fast cells by reducing the membrane time constant. This is
                 an expensive strategy, involving large conductances and
                 currents. Slowly flying nocturnal insects do not require a
                 high speed of response. The potassium conductances in their
                 slow photoreceptors inactivate to avoid costly and unnecessary
                 ion fluxes. 8. Both the dynamics of the photoresponse and
                 photoreceptor membrane properties exhibit sexual dimorphism.
                 Light adapted photoreceptors in the enlarged male dorsal eye
                 of Bibio markii have a corner frequency of 42 Hz, compared
                 with 27 Hz for cells in the smaller female eye. This
                 difference in frequency response correlates with the male's
                 higher spatial acuity and is accompanied by consistent
                 differences in potassium conductance activation rate. We
                 conclude that the divison between fast and slow cells is the
                 product of cellular constraints, metabolic costs and the
                 requirements of coding efficiency at different light levels

                 experiments suggested that flies use active neural-circuit
                 mechanisms to suppress the perception of self-generated visual
                 motion during intended turns. Direct electrophysiological
                 evidence, however, has been lacking. We found that visual
                 neurons in Drosophila receive motor-related inputs during
                 rapid flight turns. These inputs arrived with a sign and
                 latency appropriate for suppressing each targeted cell's

                 behavioral and neuronal response latencies supported the idea

                 The function and biophysical mechanisms of most such
                 modulations remain unresolved. Here, we combine behavioral
                 genetics, electrophysiology, and high-speed videography to
                 advance a function for behavioral modulations of visual
                 processing in Drosophila. We argue that a set of
                 motion-sensitive visual neurons regulate gaze-stabilizing head
                 movements. We describe how, during flight turns, Drosophila
                 perform a set of head movements that require silencing their
                 gaze-stability reflexes along the primary rotation axis of the
                 turn. Consistent with this behavioral requirement, we find
                 pervasive motor-related inputs to the visual neurons, which
                 quantitatively silence their predicted visual responses to
                 rotations around the relevant axis while preserving
                 sensitivity around other axes. This work proposes a function
                 for a behavioral modulation of visual processing and
                 illustrates how the brain can remove one sensory signal from a

                 acquisition of information. However, part of the sensory
                 information is generated actively when animals move. For
                 instance, humans shift their gaze actively in a sequence of
                 saccades towards interesting locations in a scene. Likewise,
                 many insects shift their gaze by saccadic turns of body and
                 head, keeping their gaze fixed between saccades. Here we
                 employ a novel panoramic virtual reality stimulator and show
                 that motion computation in a blowfly visual interneuron is
                 tuned to make efficient use of the characteristic dynamics of
                 retinal image flow. The neuron is able to extract information
                 about the spatial layout of the environment by utilizing
                 intervals of stable vision resulting from the saccadic viewing
                 strategy. The extraction is possible because the retinal image
                 flow evoked by translation, containing information about
                 object distances, is confined to low frequencies. This flow
                 component can be derived from the total optic flow between
                 saccades because the residual intersaccadic head rotations are
                 small and encoded at higher frequencies. Information about the
                 spatial layout of the environment can thus be extracted by the
                 neuron in a computationally parsimonious way. These results on

                 compensatory head movements. During self-movement, head

                 of nonspiking local interneurons were studied in isolated
                 locust thoracic ganglia, using the switched current- and
                 voltage-clamp techniques in neuropilar recordings. The average
                 transmembrane potential (Vr) of the interneurons was -58 +/-
                 6mV (n = 85), and the input resistance (in the linear region
                 of the current-voltage curve) was 16.5 +/- 8 M omega (n = 19,
                 range 8 to 32 M omega). The membrane and equalizing time
                 constants were estimated from charging curves evoked by the
                 injection of low density hyperpolarizing current pulses from
                 about -80 mV, i.e., from voltages in the linear region of the
                 I-V curve. The curves yielded 2 time constants (tau m and tau
                 l) whose average values were 33.2 +/- 9 msec and 3.3 +/- 1
                 msec (n = 18), respectively. The mean specific membrane
                 resistance is therefore about 33 k omega.cm2, assuming that
                 the membrane capacitance is ca. 1 microF.cm-2. An outward
                 rectification was always observed upon depolarization from
                 potentials more negative than Vr and was accompanied by a
                 decrease in input resistance and membrane time constant. The
                 ``resting'' membrane, for example, had a time constant of 26.4
                 +/- 8 msec (n = 31). This outward rectification was due to at
                 least 2 conductances with different inactivation kinetics,
                 similar to the transient ``A'' and ``delayed-rectifier''
                 potassium conductances. No inward rectification was ever
                 observed upon injection of hyperpolarizing current. In about
                 60\% of the recordings, an active and TTX-resistant
                 depolarizing process could be evoked by rapid depolarization
                 around Vr. The voltage-dependent properties of the membrane of
                 the nonspiking local interneurons had dramatic effects on the
                 shape and time course of natural or evoked unitary PSPs. The
                 half-width of EPSPs, for example, decreased by a factor of 7.5
                 if the membrane potential was shifted from -93 to -50 mV. When
                 the membrane potential of an interneuron was altered with a
                 triangular current waveform, the reduction of tonically
                 occurring IPSPs depended more on the sign and rate of the
                 induced voltage change than on the absolute transmembrane
                 potential. For 2 identical instantaneous values of membrane
                 potential, for example, the reduction of the PSPs was greater
                 during the depolarizing phase than during the hyperpolarizing
                 phase of the current waveform. The possible nature of the
                 active membrane conductances underlying the nonlinear
                 electrical behavior of the membrane is discussed, together

                 receptive fields of the 10 VS neurons, we determined with a
                 new method the distributions of local motion sensitivities and
                 local preferred directions at 52 positions in the fly's visual

                 Intracellular recordings from intact retina confirm that the
                 light-adapted photoreceptors of the crane fly Tipula paludosa
                 (Diptera; Tipulidae) have a slow response, appropriate for
                 their visual ecology. To provide a slow response, the

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Self-generated body movements require compensatory
                 eye and head adjustments in order to avoid perturbation of
                 visual information processing. Retinal image stabilization is
                 traditionally ascribed to the transformation of
                 visuovestibular signals into appropriate extraocular motor
                 commands for compensatory ocular movements. During locomotion,
                 however, intrinsic ``efference copies'' of the motor commands
                 deriving from spinal central pattern generator (CPG) activity
                 potentially offer a reliable and rapid mechanism for image
                 stabilization, in addition to the slower contribution of
                 movement-encoding sensory inputs. RESULTS: Using a variety of
                 in vitro and in vivo preparations of Xenopus tadpoles, we
                 demonstrate that spinal locomotor CPG-derived efference copies
                 do indeed produce effective conjugate eye movements that
                 counteract oppositely directed horizontal head displacements
                 during undulatory tail-based locomotion. The efference copy
                 transmission, by which the extraocular motor system becomes
                 functionally appropriated to the spinal cord, is mediated by
                 direct ascending pathways. Although the impact of the CPG
                 feedforward commands matches the spatiotemporal specificity of
                 classical vestibulo-ocular responses, the two fundamentally
                 different signals do not contribute collectively to image
                 stabilization during swimming. Instead, when the CPG is
                 active, horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflexes resulting from
                 head movements are selectively suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: These
                 results therefore challenge our traditional understanding of
                 how animals offset the disruptive effects of propulsive body
                 movements on visual processing. Specifically, our finding that
                 predictive efference copies of intrinsic, rhythmic neural
                 signals produced by the locomotory CPG supersede, rather than
                 supplement, reactive vestibulo-ocular reflexes in order to
                 drive image-stabilizing eye adjustments during larval frog
                 swimming, represents a hitherto unreported mechanism for
                 vertebrate ocular motor control.",

  abstract    = "1. The impulse-response was used to measure the dynamics of
                 the photoresponse of 8 species of insects from 6 orders in
                 both light- and dark-adapted states. 2. The impulse-responses
                 of all cells were well fitted by the two-parameter log-normal
                 curve. 3. In the dark-adapted state, the time-to-peak of the
                 response varies from 38 ms in the drone-fly to 55 ms in the
                 locust. Though interspecies variation is small, the
                 house-flyMusca (41 ms) is significantly faster than the
                 locust. In the light-adapted state, there are highly
                 significant variations in the time-to-peak between species.
                 The order is: housefly (12.0 ms), drone-fly (16.5 ms),
                 dragonfly (17.5 ms), mantid (18.1 ms), locust (21.9 ms) and
                 cricket (22.1 ms). This variation in speed correlates with
                 flight behavior. 4. There are significant, though small,
                 differences in the shape of the dark-adapted impulseresponse,
                 with that of the cockroach more symmetrical and the dragonfly
                 more skew than the others. The impulse-response of the fly in
                 the lightadapted state is more symmetrical than that of the
                 other species and results in an even higher frequency
                 response. 5. Despite these differences in shape, it is
                 concluded that all species have a similar transduction
                 mechanism. Interspecies differences in time-scale can, at
                 first approximation, be accounted for by the change of a
                 single time-constant. 6. The insects' impulse-responses were
                 compared to those of verbrates by using the cascade models of
                 Fuortes and Hodgkin (1964) and Baylor et al. (1974). A large
                 number of stages were required (between 10 and 50) and a
                 greater than 50\% variation in the number of stages was needed
                 in order to fit response from different cells within a single
                 species. Furthermore, the basic assumption of Fuortes and
                 Hodgkin (1964) that the timecourse is causally linked to the
                 gain does not hold in the insect. We conclude that no
                 first-order system of chemical cascades can sensibly predict
                 either the time-course of the photoresponse in insects, or the
                 effects of light adaptation and hence that the insect
                 transduction mechanism is fundamentally different to that of
                 vertebrates. Finally, we find that a model using two first
                 order poles, two underdamped second order poles and a pure
                 time delay (French 1980a, b) provides as good a fit to the
                 frequency response as does the log-normal model.",

                 population, and noise correlation between the participating
                 neurons. The population we study consists of 10 identified

                 integration of neuronal activities over a time period of only
                 5 ms after response onset is sufficient to decode accurately
                 the rotation axis. Second, noise correlation between neurons
                 has only little impact on the population's performance. And
                 third, although a population of only two neurons would be
                 sufficient to encode any horizontal rotation axis, the
                 population of 10 vertical system neurons is advantageous if
                 the available integration time is short. For the fly, short

                 given the statistical fluctuations inherent in the experiments

                 current pulse (Fig. 10). The resulting compartmental models

                 to gaze stabilization during rotations under both head-fixed
                 [vestibuloocular (VOR)] and head-free conditions in two avian
                 species: pigeons and quails. These two species differ both in
                 ocular anatomy (the pigeon has 2 distinct foveal regions), as
                 well as in behavioral repertoires. Pigeons are arboreal, fly
                 extended distances, and can navigate. Quails are primarily
                 engrossed in terrestrial niches and fly only short distances.
                 Unlike the head-fixed VOR gains that were under-compensatory
                 for both species, gaze gains under head-free conditions were
                 completely compensatory at high frequencies. This compensation
                 was achieved primarily with head movements in pigeons, but
                 with combined head and eye-in-head contributions in the quail.
                 In contrast, eye-in-head motion, which was significantly
                 reduced for head-free compared with head-fixed conditions,
                 contributed very little to overall gaze stability in pigeons.
                 These results suggest that disparity between the stabilization

                 regularities in the environment. Thus, disparity is commonly
                 regarded as the best visual cue for determining 3D layout. But
                 depth from disparity is only precise near where one is
                 looking; it is quite imprecise elsewhere. Away from fixation,
                 vision resorts to using other depth cues-e.g., linear
                 perspective, familiar size, aerial perspective. But those cues
                 depend on statistical regularities in the environment and are
                 therefore not always reliable. Depth from defocus blur relies
                 on fewer assumptions and has the same geometric constraints as
                 disparity but different physiological constraints. Blur could
                 in principle fill in the parts of visual space where disparity

                 temporal factors contribute to its ability to resolve the
                 movement. In the present work we have combined currently
                 available knowledge about the early stages of fly vision
                 (optical system, photoreceptors, and large monopolar cells) to

                 suggest that locusts are able to exploit the sky polarization

                 detect polarized light through a specialized dorsal rim area
                 (DRA) of the eye. Polarization signals are transmitted through
                 the optic lobe to the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu) and,
                 finally, to the central complex in the brain. Whereas neurons
                 of the AOTu integrate sky polarization and chromatic cues in a
                 daytime dependent manner, the central complex holds a
                 topographic representation of azimuthal directions suggesting
                 a role as an internal sky compass. To understand further the
                 integration of sky compass cues we studied
                 polarization-sensitive (POL) neurons in the medulla that may
                 be intercalated between DRA photoreceptors and AOTu neurons.
                 Five types of POL-neuron were characterized and four of these
                 in multiple recordings. All neurons had wide arborizations in
                 medulla layer 4 and most, additionally, in the dorsal rim area

                 Therefore, medulla layer 4 is a distinct stage in the

                 the responses of an identifiable neuron, the V1 tangential

                 similar to those the fly encounters during particular

                 ``planetarium-projector,'' casting a pattern of moving light

                 body axes, 2) upward/downward translation, and 3) a

                 not respond as specifically to self-rotations, as had been

                 between the responses to global optic flow and the predictions

                 nonlinear integration properties of tangential neurons.
                 Response parameters like orientation, shape, and width of the

                 is known about the neural circuits that perform the visual
                 motor computations that underlie this ability. We investigated
                 the motor neurons that innervate two neck muscles (m44 and
                 m51), which produce stabilizing yaw movements of the head.
                 Intracellular recordings were made from five (out of eight)
                 identified neuron types in the first cervical nerve (IK1) of
                 honeybees. Two motor neurons that innervate muscle 51 were
                 found to be direction-selective, with a preference for
                 horizontal image motion from the contralateral to the
                 ipsilateral side of the head. Three neurons that innervate
                 muscle 44 were tuned to detect motion in the opposite
                 direction (from ipsilateral to contralateral). These cells
                 were binocularly sensitive and responded optimally to frontal
                 stimulation. By combining the directional tuning of the motor
                 neurons in an opponent manner, the neck motor system would be

                 compass information from the polarization pattern of the blue
                 sky. The desert locust Schistocerca gregaria detects polarized
                 light with a specialized dorsal rim area of its compound eye.
                 In the locust brain, polarized-light signals are passed
                 through the anterior optic tract and tubercle to the central
                 complex which most likely serves as an internal sky compass.
                 Here, we suggest that neurons of a second visual pathway, via
                 the accessory medulla and posterior optic tubercle, also
                 provide polarization information to the central complex.
                 Intracellular recordings show that two types of neuron in this
                 posterior pathway are sensitive to polarized light. One cell
                 type connects the dorsal rim area of the medulla with the
                 medulla and accessory medulla, and a second type connects the
                 bilaterally paired posterior optic tubercles. Given the
                 evidence for a role of the accessory medulla as the master

                 spectral sensitivity of the neural pathways that underlie this
                 motion behavior has been difficult, and the contribution of
                 the simple eyes (ocelli) has been rarely examined. In this
                 study we investigate the spectral response properties and
                 ocellar inputs of an anatomically identified descending neuron
                 (DNII(2)) in the honeybee optomotor pathway. Using a panoramic
                 stimulus, we show that it responds selectively to optic flow
                 associated with pitch rotations. The neuron is also stimulated
                 with a custom-built light-emitting diode array that presented
                 moving bars that were either all-green (spectrum 500-600 nm,
                 peak 530 nm) or all-short wavelength (spectrum 350-430 nm,
                 peak 380 nm). Although the optomotor response is thought to be
                 dominated by green-sensitive inputs, we show that DNII(2) is
                 equally responsive to, and direction selective to, both green-
                 and short-wavelength stimuli. The color of the background
                 image also influences the spontaneous spiking behavior of the
                 cell: a green background produces significantly higher
                 spontaneous spiking rates. Stimulating the ocelli produces
                 strong modulatory effects on DNII(2), significantly increasing
                 the amplitude of its responses in the preferred motion
                 direction and decreasing the response latency by adding a
                 directional, short-latency response component. Our results

                 technique. In CH cells, two currents were identified (Figs. 1,
                 2): a slow calcium inward current and a delayed rectifying,
                 noninactivating potassium outward current. HS and VS cells
                 appear to possess similar currents to CH cells, but in
                 addition, exhibit a fast-activating sodium inward current and
                 a sodium-activated potassium outward current (Figs. 3, 4).
                 While the delayed rectifying potassium current in all three
                 cell classes is responsible for the observed outward
                 rectification described previously (Borst and Haag, 1996), the
                 sodium inward current produced the fast and irregular
                 spikelike depolarizations found in HS and VS cells but not in
                 CH cells: When the sodium current is blocked by either. TTX or
                 intracellular QX314, no more action potentials can be elicited
                 in HS cells under current-clamp conditions (Fig. 5). As is
                 demonstrated in HS cells, space clamp conditions are
                 sufficient to suppress synaptically induced action potentials
                 (Fig. 6). The currents described above were incorporated with
                 the appropriate characteristics into compartmental models of

                 model cells qualitatively mimicked the fly tangential cells
                 under current clamp conditions in response to current
                 injection (Fig. 10). The simulations demonstrated that the

                 passive models or in active models during continuous
                 hyperpolarization, decreased significantly in the active
                 models during continuous depolarization (Fig. 11). Active HS

                 system. One of the cells, the H1-cell, is a spiking neuron,
                 whereas the other, the HS-cell, encodes sensory information
                 mainly by a graded shift of its membrane potential. Using a
                 pseudo-random velocity waveform by which a visual grating is
                 moving along the horizontal axis of the eye, both cell types
                 follow the stimulus velocity at higher precision than in
                 response to a step-like velocity function. To measure how much
                 information about the stimulus velocity is preserved in the
                 cellular responses, we calculated the coherence between the
                 stimulus and the neural signals as a function of stimulus
                 frequency. At frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz motion
                 information is well contained in the electrical signals of HS-
                 and H1-cells: For HS-cells the coherence value amounts to
                 approximately 70\%, and for H1-cells this value is
                 approximately 60\%. Comparing these values with the coherence
                 expected from a linear encoding reveals that the fidelity of
                 the original stimulus is deteriorated in the neural signal
                 partly by neural noise and partly by the nonlinearity inherent
                 in the process of visual motion detection. The degree to which
                 this nonlinearity contributes to the decrease in coherence
                 depends on the maximum velocity used in the experiments; the
                 smaller the stimulus amplitude, the higher the coherence and,
                 thus, the smaller the nonlinearity in encoding of stimulus
                 motion. All these results are in agreement with model
                 simulations in which visual motion is processed by an array of
                 local motion detectors, the spatially integrated output of

                 has been blocked for decades at the second optic neuropil, the
                 medulla, a two-part relay comprising 10 strata (M1-M10), and
                 the largest neuropil in the fly's brain. Based on the
                 modularity of its composition, and two previous reports, on
                 Golgi-impregnated cell types (Fischbach and Dittrich, Cell
                 Tissue Res.,1989; 258:441-475) and their synaptic circuits in
                 the first neuropil, the lamina, we used serial-section
                 electron microscopy to examine inputs to the distal strata
                 M1-M6. We report the morphology of the reconstructed medulla
                 terminals of five lamina cells, L1-L5, two photoreceptors, R7
                 and R8, and three neurons, medulla cell T1 and centrifugal
                 cells C2 and C3. The morphology of these conforms closely to
                 previous reports from Golgi impregnation. This fidelity
                 provides assurance that our reconstructions are complete and
                 accurate. Synapses of these terminals broadly localize to the
                 terminal and provide contacts to unidentified targets, mostly
                 medulla cells, as well as sites of connection between the
                 terminals themselves. These reveal that R8 forms contacts upon
                 R7 and thus between these two spectral inputs; that L3
                 provides input upon both pathways, adding an achromatic input;
                 that the terminal of L5 reciprocally connects to that of L1,
                 thus being synaptic in the medulla despite lacking synapses in
                 the lamina; that the motion-sensing input cells L1 and L2 lack
                 direct interconnection but both receive input from C2 and C3,
                 resembling lamina connections of these cells; and that, as in
                 the lamina, T1 provides no output chemical synapses.",

                   the blowfly visual system, and present a theoretical
                   framework for analyzing the experimental results, starting
                   from the Poisson process. We find that blowfly
                   photoreceptors, up to frequencies of 50-100 Hz and photon
                   capture rates of up to about 3*10^5/s, operate well within
                   an order of magnitude from ideal photon counters.
                   Photoreceptors signals are transmitted to LMCs through an
                   array of chemical synapses. We quantify a lower bound on LMC
                   reliability, which in turn provides a lower bound on
                   synaptic vesicle release rate, assuming Poisson statistics.
                   This bound is much higher than what is found in published
                   direct measurements of vesicle release rates in goldfish
                   bipolar cells, suggesting that release statistics may be
                   significantly sub-Poisson. Finally we study H1, a motion
                   sensitive tangential cell in the fly's lobula plate, which
                   transmits information about a continuous signal by sequences
                   of action potentials. In an experiment with naturalistic
                   motion stimuli performed on a sunny day outside in the
                   field, H1 transmits information at about 50\% coding
                   efficiency down to millisecond spike timing precision.
                   Comparing the measured reliability of H1's response to
                   motion steps with the bounds on the accuracy of motion
                   computation set by photoreceptor noise, we find that the
                   fly's brain makes efficient use of the information available
                   in the photoreceptor array.",

  abstract    = "We present a computational model for target discrimination
                 based on intracellular recordings from neurons in the fly
                 visual system. Determining how insects detect and track small
                 moving features, often against cluttered moving backgrounds,
                 is an intriguing challenge, both from a physiological and a
                 computational perspective. Previous research has characterized
                 higher-order neurons within the fly brain, known as 'small
                 target motion detectors' (STMD), that respond robustly to
                 moving features, even when the velocity of the target is
                 matched to the background (i.e. with no relative motion cues).
                 We recorded from intermediate-order neurons in the fly visual
                 system that are well suited as a component along the target
                 detection pathway. This full-wave rectifying, transient cell
                 (RTC) reveals independent adaptation to luminance changes of
                 opposite signs (suggesting separate ON and OFF channels) and
                 fast adaptive temporal mechanisms, similar to other cell types
                 previously described. From this physiological data we have
                 created a numerical model for target discrimination. This
                 model includes nonlinear filtering based on the fly optics,
                 the photoreceptors, the 1(st) order interneurons (Large
                 Monopolar Cells), and the newly derived parameters for the
                 RTC. We show that our RTC-based target detection model is well
                 matched to properties described for the STMDs, such as
                 contrast sensitivity, height tuning and velocity tuning. The
                 model output shows that the spatiotemporal profile of small
                 targets is sufficiently rare within natural scene imagery to
                 allow our highly nonlinear 'matched filter' to successfully
                 detect most targets from the background. Importantly, this
                 model can explain this type of feature discrimination without
                 the need for relative motion cues.",

  title       = "Selective attention in an insect visual neuron",
  author      = "Wiederman, Steven D and O'Carroll, David C",
  abstract    = "Animals need attention to focus on one target amid alternative
                 distracters. Dragonflies, for example, capture flies in swarms
                 comprising prey and conspecifics, a feat that requires neurons
                 to select one moving target from competing alternatives.
                 Diverse evidence, from functional imaging and physiology to
                 psychophysics, highlights the importance of such ``competitive
                 selection'' in attention for vertebrates. Analogous mechanisms
                 have been proposed in artificial intelligence and even in
                 invertebrates, yet direct neural correlates of attention are
                 scarce from all animal groups. Here, we demonstrate responses
                 from an identified dragonfly visual neuron that perfectly
                 match a model for competitive selection within limits of
                 neuronal variability (r(2) = 0.83). Responses to individual
                 targets moving at different locations within the receptive
                 field differ in both magnitude and time course. However,
                 responses to two simultaneous targets exclusively track those
                 for one target alone rather than any combination of the pair.
                 Irrespective of target size, contrast, or separation, this
                 neuron selects one target from the pair and perfectly
                 preserves the response, regardless of whether the ``winner''
                 is the stronger stimulus if presented alone. This neuron is
                 amenable to electrophysiological recordings, providing
                 neuroscientists with a new model system for studying selective
                 attention.",
