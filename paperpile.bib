                 movements of flying blowflies, were replayed on a panoramic
                 stimulus device. The directional movement-sensitive H1 neuron
                 was recorded from blowflies watching these stimuli. The
                 response of the H1 neuron is dominated by the response to fast
                 saccadic turns into one direction. The response between
                 saccades is mostly inhibited by the front-to-back optic flow
                 caused by the forward translation during flight. To unravel
                 the functional significance of the H1 neuron, we replayed, in
                 addition to the original behaviorally generated stimulus, two
                 targeted stimulus modifications: (1) a stimulus in which flow
                 resulting from translation was removed (this stimulus produced
                 strong intersaccadic responses); and (2) a stimulus in which
                 the saccades were removed by assuming that the head follows
                 the smooth flight trajectory (this stimulus produced
                 alternating zero or nearly saturating spike rates). The
                 responses to the two modified stimuli are strongly different
                 from the response to the original stimulus, showing the
                 importance of translation and saccades for the H1 response to
                 natural optic flow. The response to the original stimulus thus
                 suggests a double function for the H1 neuron, assisting two
                 major classes of movement-sensitive output neurons targeted by
                 H1. First, its strong response to saccades may function as a
                 saccadic suppressor (via one of its target neurons) for cells
                 involved in figure-ground discrimination. Second, its
                 intersaccadic response may increase the signal-to-noise ratio
                 (SNR) of wide-field neurons involved in detecting
                 translational optic flow between saccades, in particular when
                 flying speeds are low or when object distances are large.",

                 \textit{Syritta pipiens} {L}",
  author      = "Collett, T S and Land, M F",
  abstract    = "1.The visually guided flight behaviour of groups of male and
                 femaleSyritta pipiens was filmed at 50 f.p.s. and analysed
                 frame by frame. Sometimes the flies cruise around ignoring
                 each other. At other times males but not females track other
                 flies closely, during which the body axis points accurately
                 towards the leading fly.2.The eyes of males but not females
                 have a forward directed region of enlarged facets where the
                 resolution is 2 to 3 times greater than elsewhere. The
                 inter-ommatidial angle in this ``fovea'' is 0.6°.3.Targets
                 outside the fovea are fixated by accurately directed,
                 intermittent, open-loop body saccades. Fixation of moving
                 targets within the fovea is maintained by ``continuous''
                 tracking in which the angular position of the target on the
                 retina ($\Theta$e) is continuously translated into the angular
                 velocity of the tracking fly ($$\textbackslashdot
                 \textbackslashPhi _p $$) with a latency of roughly 20 ms
                 ($$\textbackslashdot \textbackslashPhi _p = k
                 \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek≏30 s−1).4.The tracking fly
                 maintains a roughly constant distance (in the range 5--15 cm)
                 from the target. If the distance between the two flies is more
                 than some set value the fly moves forwards, if it is less the
                 fly moves backwards. The forward or backward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p $$) increases with the difference
                 (D-D0) between the actual and desired distance
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p = k^\textbackslashprime (D - D_0
                 )$$), wherek′=10 to 20 s−1). It is argued that the fly
                 computes distance by measuring the vertical substense of the
                 target image on the retina.5.Angular tracking is sometimes, at
                 the tracking fly's choice,supplemented by changes in sideways
                 velocity. The fly predicts a suitable sideways velocity
                 probably on the basis of a running average$\Theta$e, but not
                 its instantaneous value. Alternatively, when the target is
                 almost stationary, angular tracking may bereplaced by sideways
                 tracking. In this case the sideways velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S$$) is related to$\Theta$eabout 30 ms
                 earlier ($$\textbackslashdot S_p = k\textbackslashprime
                 \textbackslashprime \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek″=2.5 cm
                 · s−1 · deg−1), and the angular tracking system is
                 inoperative.6.When the leading fly settles the tracking fly
                 often moves rapidly sideways in an arc centred on the leading
                 fly. During thesevoluntary sideways movements the male
                 continues to point his head at the target. He does this not by
                 correcting$\Theta$e, which is usually zero, but by predicting
                 the angular velocity needed to maintain fixation. This
                 prediction requires knowledge of both the distance between the
                 flies and the tracking fly's sideways velocity. It is shown
                 that the fly tends to over-estimate distance by about
                 20\%.7.When two males meet head on during tracking the pursuit
                 may be cut short as a result of vigorous sideways oscillations
                 of both flies. These side-to-side movements are synchronised
                 so that the males move in opposite directions, and the
                 oscillations usually grow in size until the males separate.
                 The angular tracking system is active during ``wobbling'' and
                 it is shown that to synchronise the two flies the sideways
                 tracking system must also be operative. The combined action of
                 both systems in the two flies leads to instability and so
                 provides a simple way of automatically separating two
                 males.8.Tracking is probably sexual in function and often
                 culminates in a rapid dart towards the leading fly, after the
                 latter has settled. During these ``rapes'' the male
                 accelerates continuously at about 500 cm · s−2, turning just
                 before it lands so that it is in the copulatory position. The
                 male rapes flies of either sex indicating that successful
                 copulation involves more trial and error than
                 recognition.9.During cruising flight the angular velocity of
                 the fly is zero except for brief saccadic turns. There is
                 often a sideways component to flight which means that the body
                 axis is not necessarily in the direction of flight. Changes in
                 flight direction are made either by means of saccades or by
                 adjusting the ratio of sideways to forward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$). Changes in body
                 axis are frequently made without any change in the direction
                 of flight. On these occasions, when the fly makes an angular
                 saccade, it simultaneously adjusts$$\textbackslashdot
                 S/\textbackslashdot F$$by an appropriate amount.10.Flies
                 change course when they approach flowers using the same
                 variety of mechanisms: a series of saccades, adjustments
                 to$$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$, or by a mixture
                 of the two.11.The optomotor response, which tends to prevent
                 rotation except during saccades, is active both during
                 cruising and tracking flight.",

                 Hz contrast frequency for gratings of spatial wavelength 15
                 degrees). To investigate the neural basis of these movements
                 we have combined videomicroscopy with electrophysiological
                 stimulation and recording to demonstrate that excitation of
                 prothoracic motor neurons projecting in the anterodorsal (ADN)
                 and frontal nerves (FN), respectively, generates the yaw and
                 roll head movements measured behaviorally. Electrical
                 stimulation of the ADN produces head yaw. The visual stimuli
                 which excite the two ADN motor neurons (ADN MNs) are
                 horizontal motion of gratings or spots moving clockwise around
                 the yaw axis in the case of the right ADN (counterclockwise
                 for left ADN). Activity is inhibited by motion in the opposite
                 direction. Spatial sensitivity varies in the yaw plane with a
                 maximum between 0 degree and 40 degrees ipsilaterally, but
                 both excitation and inhibition are elicited out to 80 degrees
                 in the ipsilateral and contralateral fields. ADN MNs respond
                 to contrast frequencies up to 15-20 Hz, with a peak around 2-4
                 Hz for grating motion in the excitatory or inhibitory

                 motion has the opposite effect: Upward is excitatory and

                 frequencies in the same range as the ADN MNs, with peak

                 generate appropriate behavior. Exactly how these different
                 sensory inputs are fused at the motor system is not well
                 understood. Here we study how fly neck motor neurons integrate
                 information from two well characterized sensory systems:
                 visual information from the compound eye and gyroscopic
                 information from the mechanosensory halteres. Extracellular
                 recordings reveal that a subpopulation of neck motor neurons
                 display ``gating-like'' behavior: they do not fire action
                 potentials in response to visual stimuli alone but will do so
                 if the halteres are coactivated. Intracellular recordings show
                 that these motor neurons receive small, sustained subthreshold
                 visual inputs in addition to larger inputs that are phase
                 locked to haltere movements. Our results suggest that the
                 nonlinear gating-like effect results from summation of these
                 two inputs with the action potential threshold providing the
                 nonlinearity. As a result of this summation, the sustained
                 visual depolarization is transformed into a temporally
                 structured train of action potentials synchronized to the
                 haltere beating movements. This simple mechanism efficiently
                 fuses two different sensory signals and may also explain the

                 and head, keeping their gaze basically fixed between saccades.
                 For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic
                 flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly
                 motion pathway to extract information about translation of the
                 animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the
                 environment. There are noticeable differences between head and
                 body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and
                 shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more
                 stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we
                 analyse the functional importance of these differences by
                 probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with
                 optic flow based on either head movements or body movements,
                 as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique.
                 We find that the precise head-body coordination is essential
                 for the visual system to separate the translational from the
                 rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the
                 body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the
                 behaviourally important information on translation. Since it
                 is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental
                 paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video
                 techniques, we introduce a 'headifying algorithm', which
                 transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight
                 into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application
                 of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation
                 between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable
                 recovering information on translation. The algorithm may
                 therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed

  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the

                 compound eyes. Although the ocelli can detect only changes in
                 light intensity averaged over their large visual field, they
                 do play various roles in the behavior of insects, as they have
                 advantages over compound eyes in terms of photic sensitivity
                 and the speed of signal transmission. I summarize here our
                 present knowledge on the neural organization of ocellar
                 systems of a number of insects, and propose that they can be
                 classified into three types: (1) the ``cockroach type''
                 ocellar system where signals from the photoreceptors first
                 converge onto a small number of second-order neurons, and then
                 diverge to a large number of third-order neurons which project
                 into a number of target neuropils of the brain; (2) the ``bee
                 type'' ocellar system where photoreceptor signals are passed
                 to various target neuropils by a large number of second-order
                 neurons; and (3) the ``locust type'' ocellar system where
                 ocellar signals are transmitted to various target neuropils by
                 both second- and third-order neurons. I propose that: (1) the

                 access to the circuitry responsible for combining and
                 employing these sensory inputs. We report that lobula plate VS

  abstract    = "Flying insects exhibit stunning behavioral repertoires that
                 are largely mediated by the visual control of flight. For this
                 reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered
                 insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for
                 studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create
                 an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual
                 stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels
                 composed of an 8 x 8 array of individual LEDs, that may be
                 connected together to 'tile' an experimental environment with
                 controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be
                 extremely bright, with the added flexibility of
                 individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation
                 over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions.
                 Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom
                 software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on
                 the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication
                 interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based
                 display controller which, for most experiments, will not

                 animal experiences the same sensory input several times. This
                 variability can arise from stochastic processes inherent to
                 the nervous system. Also, the internal state of an animal may
                 influence a particular behavioural response. In the present
                 study, we analyse the variability of visually induced head
                 pitch responses of tethered blowflies by high-speed
                 cinematography. We found these optomotor responses to be
                 highly variable in amplitude. Most of the variability can be
                 attributed to two different internal states of the flies with
                 high and low optomotor gain, respectively. Even within a given
                 activity state, there is some variability of head optomotor
                 responses. The amount of this variability differs for the two
                 optomotor gain states. Moreover, these two activity states can
                 be distinguished on a fine timescale and without visual
                 stimulation, on the basis of the occurrence of peculiar head
                 jitter movements. Head jitter goes along with high gain
                 optomotor responses and haltere oscillations. Halteres are
                 evolutionary transformed hindwings that oscillate when
                 blowflies walk or fly. Their main function is to serve as
                 equilibrium organs by detecting Coriolis forces and to mediate
                 gaze stabilisation. However, their basic oscillating activity
                 was also suggested to provide a gain-modulating signal. Our
                 experiments demonstrate that halteres are not necessary for
                 high gain head pitch to occur. Nevertheless, we find the
                 halteres to be responsible for one component of head jitter
                 movements. This component may be the inevitable consequence of
                 their function as equilibrium and gaze-stabilising organs.",

                 entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the
                 lower hemisphere (Figs. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral
                 ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar lens
                 large patterns are im- aged on the receptor mosaic. Because of
                 the astigmatism of the lens, patterns in longitudinal
                 orientations are more accurately represented than in others
                 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, an artifical horizon rotated around
                 the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll.

  author      = "Stange, Gert",
  abstract    = "We present a method to record and simultaneously display the
                 three rotatory components of arbitrary head turns of an insect
                 flying stationarily in a wind tunnel or walking on a
                 treadmill.. An elongated marker, placed on the fly's forehead,
                 is video- recorded from ahead under deep red stroboscopic
                 illumination, invisible to the insect. A fast on-board image
                 processor of a PC video-adapter (True Vision, AT-Vista),
                 programmed in its native code, extracts position and
                 orientation of the marker in the video-image. The host PC
                 transforms these data into calibrated head angles and displays
                 stimulus and response components after 40 ms processing time
                 at a rate of 50 frames per second. Head turns are measured
                 relative to the fly's trunk even when the fly is rotated
                 around its body axis provided that it is aligned with the
                 video-axis. Technical tests, as well as recordings from live
                 flies responding to various stimuli, illustrate the
                 performance and accuracy of the procedure. This minimally
                 invasive method of motion recording should be easily adaptable
                 to other insects and to similar movements of small parts.",

                 recently introduced Bayesian entropy estimator to synthetic
                 data inspired by experiments, and to real experimental spike
                 trains. The estimator performs admirably even very deep in the
                 undersampled regime, where other techniques fail. This opens
                 new possibilities for the information theoretic analysis of
                 experiments, and may be of general interest as an example of
                 learning from limited data.",
