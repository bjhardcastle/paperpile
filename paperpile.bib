                 stimuli whose statistical properties are themselves evolving
                 dynamically. Adaptation to these statistics occurs over a wide
                 range of timescales-from tens of milliseconds to minutes.
                 Rapid components of adaptation serve to optimize the
                 information that action potentials carry about rapid stimulus
                 variations within the local statistical ensemble, while
                 changes in the rate and statistics of action-potential firing
                 encode information about the ensemble itself, thus resolving
                 potential ambiguities. The speed with which information is
                 optimized and ambiguities are resolved approaches the physical
                 limit imposed by statistical sampling and noise.",

                 of how information obtained by multiple sensory systems is
                 integrated to support coordinated behaviour. In the fly,
                 lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) encode self-motion by
                 integration of signals from the compound eye. The ocelli,
                 which are also capable of self-motion detection, encode
                 wide-field light intensity in the graded potentials of
                 L-neurons. Using extracellular electrode recordings I
                 discovered that an identified neuron, LPTC V1, responds to
                 stimulation of both the compound eyes and the ocelli, which
                 created an opportunity for an investigation of multisensory
