                 stimuli whose statistical properties are themselves evolving
                 dynamically. Adaptation to these statistics occurs over a wide
                 range of timescales-from tens of milliseconds to minutes.
                 Rapid components of adaptation serve to optimize the
                 information that action potentials carry about rapid stimulus
                 variations within the local statistical ensemble, while
                 changes in the rate and statistics of action-potential firing
                 encode information about the ensemble itself, thus resolving
                 potential ambiguities. The speed with which information is
                 optimized and ambiguities are resolved approaches the physical
                 limit imposed by statistical sampling and noise.",

  abstract    = "This paper presents a reduced-order model of longitudinal
                 hovering flight dynamics for dipteran insects. The
                 quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including
                 perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid
                 body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a
                 Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification
                 tools are used to identify the transfer functions from
                 biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states.
                 Stability derivatives and a state space linear system
                 describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle
                 control requirements are quantified with respect to
                 traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The
                 heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the
                 pitch/fore/aft dynamics. The haltere-on system revealed a
                 stabilized system with a slow (heave) and fast subsidence
                 mode, and a stable oscillatory mode. The haltere-off (bare
                 airframe) system revealed a slow (heave) and fast subsidence
                 mode and an unstable oscillatory mode, a modal structure in
                 agreement with CFD studies. The analysis indicates that
                 passive aerodynamic mechanisms contribute to stability, which
                 may help explain how insects are able to achieve stable
                 locomotion on a very small computational budget.",

@ARTICLE{Land1999-lm,
  title       = "{Motion and vision: why animals move their eyes}",
  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the
                 scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.",

                 of how information obtained by multiple sensory systems is
                 integrated to support coordinated behaviour. In the fly,
                 lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) encode self-motion by

  abstract    = "The 3 ocelli of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala, grouped
                 close together on the top of the head (Fig. 1), have large,
                 extensively overlapping visual fields. Together they view the
                 entire upper hemisphere of the surroundings plus part of the
                 lower hemisphere (Figs. 5, 7). It is shown for the lateral
                 ocelli that despite the underfocussing of the ocellar lens
                 large patterns are im- aged on the receptor mosaic. Because of
                 the astigmatism of the lens, patterns in longitudinal
                 orientations are more accurately represented than in others
                 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, an artifical horizon rotated around
                 the long axis of the animal does not elicit head roll.
                 Likewise, changes of overall brightness in the visual field of
                 the median and one lateral ocellus elicit only weak
                 phasic-tonic ``dorsal light responses'' of the animal which
                 supplement the tonic dorsal light responses mediated by the
                 compound eyes (Figs. 9, 10). Our results show that, in
                 Calliphora, the ocelli have little influence on head
                 orientation during flight, and must be assumed to serve other
                 functions.",
