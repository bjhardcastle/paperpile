                 stimuli whose statistical properties are themselves evolving
                 dynamically. Adaptation to these statistics occurs over a wide
                 range of timescales-from tens of milliseconds to minutes.
                 Rapid components of adaptation serve to optimize the
                 information that action potentials carry about rapid stimulus
                 variations within the local statistical ensemble, while
                 changes in the rate and statistics of action-potential firing
                 encode information about the ensemble itself, thus resolving
                 potential ambiguities. The speed with which information is
                 optimized and ambiguities are resolved approaches the physical
                 limit imposed by statistical sampling and noise.",

                 spike detection techniques are especially important for probes
                 which have fixed electrode sites that cannot be independently
                 manipulated to isolate signals from specific neurons. Low
                 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and similarity of spectral
                 characteristic between the target signal and background noise
                 are obstacles to spike detection. We propose a new technique
                 based on cumulative energy.",
