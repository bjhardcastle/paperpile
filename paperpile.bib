                 homeostatic control mechanisms. Unlike other organs, the eye
                 relies on vision as a principal input to guide growth. In this
                 review, we consider several implications of this visual
                 guidance. First, we compare the regulation of eye growth to
                 that of other organs. Second, we ask how the visual system
                 derives signals that distinguish the blur of an eye too large
                 from one too small. Third, we ask what cascade of chemical
                 signals constitutes this growth control system. Finally, if
                 the match between the length and optics of the eye is under
                 homeostatic control, why do children so commonly develop
                 myopia, and why does the myopia not limit itself?
                 Long-neglected studies may provide an answer to this last

                 explanatory concept in vertebrate motor control. The essential
                 idea is that an important function implemented by nervous
                 systems is prediction of the sensory consequences of action.
                 This is often associated with higher cognitive capabilities;
                 however, many of the purposes forward models are thought to
                 have analogues in insect behaviour, and the concept is closely
                 connected to those of 'efference copy' and 'corollary

                 fermenting food sources. Prior studies used walking flies
                 exclusively, yet adults track distant food sources on the
                 wing. Here we show that a fly tethered within a magnetic field
                 allowing free rotation about the yaw axis actively seeks a
                 narrow CO(2) plume during flight. Genetic disruption of the
                 canonical CO(2)-sensing olfactory neurons does not alter
                 in-flight attraction to CO(2); however, antennal ablation and
                 genetic disruption of the Ir64a acid sensor do. Surprisingly,
                 mutation of the obligate olfactory coreceptor (Orco) does not

                 critical physiological processes during flight, and blocking
                 synaptic output from octopamine neurons inverts the valence
                 assigned to CO(2) and elicits an aversive response in flight.
                 Combined, our results suggest that a novel Orco-mediated

                 compass cue for orientation and navigation. In the fruit fly,
                 Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptors R7 and R8 in the
                 dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eye are specialized to
                 detect the electric vector (e-vector) of linearly polarized
                 light. These photoreceptors are arranged in stacked pairs with
                 identical fields of view and spectral sensitivities, but
                 mutually orthogonal microvillar orientations. As in larger
                 flies, we found that the microvillar orientation of the distal
                 photoreceptor R7 changes in a fan-like fashion along the DRA.
                 This anatomical arrangement suggests that the DRA constitutes
                 a detector for skylight polarization, in which different
                 e-vectors maximally excite different positions in the array.
                 To test our hypothesis, we measured responses to polarized
                 light of varying e-vector angles in the terminals of R7/8
                 cells using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our data
                 confirm a progression of preferred e-vector angles from
                 anterior to posterior in the DRA, and a strict orthogonality
                 between the e-vector preferences of paired R7/8 cells. We
                 observed decreased activity in photoreceptors in response to
                 flashes of light polarized orthogonally to their preferred
                 e-vector angle, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between
                 photoreceptors in the same medullar column, which may serve to
                 increase polarization contrast. Together, our results indicate
                 that the polarization-vision system relies on a spatial map of
                 preferred e-vector angles at the earliest stage of sensory
                 processing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The fly's visual system is
                 an influential model system for studying neural computation,
                 and much is known about its anatomy, physiology, and
                 development. The circuits underlying motion processing have
                 received the most attention, but researchers are increasingly
                 investigating other functions, such as color perception and
                 object recognition. In this work, we investigate the early
                 neural processing of a somewhat exotic sense, called
                 polarization vision. Because skylight is polarized in an
                 orientation that is rigidly determined by the position of the
                 sun, this cue provides compass information. Behavioral
                 experiments have shown that many species use the polarization
                 pattern in the sky to direct locomotion. Here we describe the
                 input stage of the fly's polarization-vision system.",

                 Chittka, Lars and Glover, Beverley J",
  abstract    = "Iridescence is a form of structural coloration, produced by a
                 range of structures, in which hue is dependent on viewing
                 angle [1-4]. One of these structures, the diffraction grating,
                 is found both in animals (for example, beetles [2]) and in
                 plants (on the petals of some animal pollinated flowers [5]).
                 The behavioral impacts of floral iridescence and its potential
                 ecological significance are unknown [6-9]. Animal-pollinated
                 flowers are described as ``sensory billboards'' [10], with
                 many floral features contributing to a conspicuous display
                 that filters prospective pollinators. Yet floral iridescence
                 is more subtle to the human eye than that of many animal
                 displays because the floral diffraction grating is not
                 perfectly regular [5-9]. This presents a puzzle: if the
                 function of petals is to attract pollinators, then flowers
                 might be expected to optimize iridescence to increase
                 showiness. On the other hand, pollinators memorize floral
                 colors as consistent advertisements of reward quality, and
                 iridescence might corrupt flower color identity. Here we
                 tested the trade-off between flower detectability and
                 recognition, requiring bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to
                 identify artificial flowers that varied in pigmentation and
                 degree of iridescence. We find that iridescence does increase
                 target detectability but that ``perfect'' iridescence
                 (produced by an artificial diffraction grating) corrupts
                 target identity and bees make many mistakes. However,
                 ``imperfect'' floral iridescence does not lead to mistaken
                 target identity, while still benefitting flower detectability.
                 We hypothesize that similar trade-offs might be found in the
                 many naturally ``imperfect'' iridescence-producing structures
                 found in animal-animal, as well as other plant-animal,

                 hoverflies",
  author      = "Walker, Simon M and Thomas, Adrian L R and Taylor, Graham K",
  abstract    = "The alula is a hinged flap found at the base of the wings of
                 most brachyceran Diptera. The alula accounts for up to 10 per
                 cent of the total wing area in hoverflies (Syrphidae), and its
                 hinged arrangement allows the wings to be swept back over the
                 thorax and abdomen at rest. The alula is actuated via the
                 third axillary sclerite, which is a component of the wing
                 hinge that is involved in wing retraction and control. The
                 third axillary sclerite has also been implicated in the gear
                 change mechanism of flies. This mechanism allows rapid
                 switching between different modes of wing kinematics, by
                 imposing or removing contact with a mechanical stop limiting
                 movement of the wing during the lower half of the downstroke.
                 The alula operates in two distinct states during
                 flight-flipped or flat-and we hypothesize that its state
                 indicates switching between different flight modes. We used
                 high-speed digital video of free-flying hoverflies (Eristalis
                 tenax and Eristalis pertinax) to investigate whether flipping
                 of the alula was associated with changes in wing and body
                 kinematics. We found that alula state was associated with
                 different distributions of multiple wing kinematic parameters,
                 including stroke amplitude, stroke deviation angle, downstroke
                 angle of incidence and timing of supination. Changes in all of
                 these parameters have previously been linked to gear change in
                 flies. Symmetric flipping of the alulae was associated with
                 changes in the symmetric linear acceleration of the body,
                 while asymmetric flipping of the alulae was associated with
                 asymmetric angular acceleration of the body. We conclude that
                 the wings produce less aerodynamic force when the alula is
                 flipped, largely as a result of the accompanying changes in
                 wing kinematics. The alula changes state at mid-downstroke,
                 which is the point at which the gear change mechanism is known
                 to come into effect. This transition is accompanied by changes
                 in the other wing kinematic parameters. We therefore find that
                 the state of the alula is linked to the same parameters as are
                 affected by the gear change mechanism. We conclude that the
                 state of the alula does indeed indicate the operation of
                 different flight modes in Eristalis, and infer that a likely
                 mechanism for these changes in flight mode is the gear change
                 mechanism.",

                 stimulus device. The directional movement-sensitive H1 neuron
                 was recorded from blowflies watching these stimuli. The
                 response of the H1 neuron is dominated by the response to fast
                 saccadic turns into one direction. The response between
                 saccades is mostly inhibited by the front-to-back optic flow
                 caused by the forward translation during flight. To unravel
                 the functional significance of the H1 neuron, we replayed, in
                 addition to the original behaviorally generated stimulus, two
                 targeted stimulus modifications: (1) a stimulus in which flow
                 resulting from translation was removed (this stimulus produced
                 strong intersaccadic responses); and (2) a stimulus in which
                 the saccades were removed by assuming that the head follows
                 the smooth flight trajectory (this stimulus produced
                 alternating zero or nearly saturating spike rates). The
                 responses to the two modified stimuli are strongly different
                 from the response to the original stimulus, showing the
                 importance of translation and saccades for the H1 response to
                 natural optic flow. The response to the original stimulus thus
                 suggests a double function for the H1 neuron, assisting two
                 major classes of movement-sensitive output neurons targeted by
                 H1. First, its strong response to saccades may function as a
                 saccadic suppressor (via one of its target neurons) for cells
                 involved in figure-ground discrimination. Second, its
                 intersaccadic response may increase the signal-to-noise ratio
                 (SNR) of wide-field neurons involved in detecting
                 translational optic flow between saccades, in particular when

  author      = "Wehner, R and Michel, B and Antonsen, P",
  abstract    = "Social hymenopterans such as bees and ants are central-place
                 foragers; they regularly depart from and return to fixed
                 positions in their environment. In returning to the starting
                 point of their foraging excursion or to any other point, they
                 could resort to two fundamentally different ways of navigation
                 by using either egocentric or geocentric systems of reference.
                 In the first case, they would rely on information continuously
                 collected en route (path integration, dead reckoning), i.e.
                 integrate all angles steered and all distances covered into a
                 mean home vector. In the second case, they are expected, at
                 least by some authors, to use a map-based system of
                 navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of
                 the spatial position they occupy within a larger environmental
                 framework. In bees and ants, path integration employing a
                 skylight compass is the predominant mechanism of navigation,
                 but geocentred landmark-based information is used as well.
                 This information is obtained while the animal is
                 dead-reckoning and, hence, added to the vector course. For
                 example, the image of the horizon skyline surrounding the nest
                 entrance is retinotopically stored while the animal approaches
                 the goal along its vector course. As shown in desert ants
                 (genus Cataglyphis), there is neither interocular nor
                 intraocular transfer of landmark information. Furthermore,
                 this retinotopically fixed, and hence egocentred, neural
                 snapshot is linked to an external (geocentred) system of
                 reference. In this way, geocentred information might more and
                 more complement and potentially even supersede the egocentred
                 information provided by the path-integration system. In
                 competition experiments, however, Cataglyphis never frees
                 itself of its homeward-bound vector - its safety-line, so to
                 speak - by which it is always linked to home. Vector
                 information can also be transferred to a longer-lasting
                 (higher-order) memory. There is no need to invoke the concept
                 of the mental analogue of a topographic map - a metric map -
                 assembled by the insect navigator. The flexible use of
                 vectors, snapshots and landmark-based routes suffices to
                 interpret the insect's behaviour. The cognitive-map approach
                 in particular, and the representational paradigm in general,

                 sensory input by changes in neuronal activity. Neuronal
                 activity changes, however, also arise from noise sources
                 within and outside the nervous system or from changes of the
                 animal's behavioral state. The resulting variability of
                 neuronal responses in representing sensory stimuli limits the
                 reliability with which animals can respond to stimuli and may
                 thus even affect the chances for survival in certain
                 situations. Relevant sources of noise arising at different
                 stages along the motion vision pathway have been investigated
                 from the sensory input to the initiation of behavioral
                 reactions. Here, we concentrate on the reliability of
                 processing visual motion information in flies. Flies rely on
                 visual motion information to guide their locomotion. They are
                 among the best established model systems for the processing of
                 visual motion information allowing us to bridge the gap
                 between behavioral performance and underlying neuronal
                 computations. It has been possible to directly assess the
                 consequences of noise at major stages of the fly's visual
                 motion processing system on the reliability of neuronal
                 signals. Responses of motion sensitive neurons and their
                 variability have been related to optomotor movements as
                 indicators for the overall performance of visual motion
                 computation. We address whether and how noise already inherent
                 in the stimulus, e.g. photon noise for the visual system,
                 influences later processing stages and to what extent
                 variability at the output level of the sensory system limits
                 behavioral performance. Recent advances in circuit analysis
                 and the progress in monitoring neuronal activity in behaving
                 animals should now be applied to understand how the animal

                 cellular analysis in both intact animal and isolated cell
                 preparations. The distribution of voltage-gated conductances
                 among photoreceptors of different species correlates with
                 visual ecology. Delayed-rectifier K+ channels are found in the
                 rapidly responding photoreceptors of fast-flying flies. The
                 conductance's activation range and dynamics match
                 light-induced signals, and enable a rapid response by reducing
                 the membrane time constant. Slow-moving flies have slowly
                 responding photoreceptors that lack the delayed rectifier, but
                 express an inactivating K+ conductance that is metabolically
                 less demanding. Complementing these findings, locust
                 photoreceptor membranes are modulated diurnally. The delayed
                 rectifier is exhibited during the day and the inactivating K+

                 demonstrate the amplification of signals by voltage-gated Na+
                 channels. In drone-bee photoreceptors, voltage-gated Na+
                 channels combine with K+ channels to enhance the small

                 metabolically costly, and a hungry animal has limited energy
                 reserves, so we hypothesized that neural activity in other
                 systems may be downregulated by food deprivation. We
                 investigated this hypothesis in the motion vision pathway of
                 the blowfly. Like other animals, flies augment their motion

                 locomotion and gaze. In the present study, walking-induced

                 for visual wide-field motion was reduced in food-deprived
                 flies. Thus, walking augmented motion vision, but the effect

                 be extracted. No matter how simple or sophisticated the eye

                 regulated in aroused states, and several lines of evidence
                 imply that this is mediated at least partly by the
                 serotonergic system. However, there is little information
                 directly showing that serotonergic function is required for
                 state-dependent modulation of sensory processing. Here we find
                 that zebrafish larvae can maintain a short-term state of
                 arousal during which neurons in the dorsal raphe modulate
                 sensory responsiveness to behaviorally relevant visual cues.
                 After a brief exposure to water flow, larvae show elevated
                 activity and heightened sensitivity to perceived motion.
                 Calcium imaging of neuronal activity after flow revealed
                 increased activity in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal
                 raphe. Genetic ablation of these neurons abolished the

                 however, less is known how this representation of ego-motion
                 is further transformed into an appropriate motor response.
                 Here, we analyzed in the blowfly Calliphora vicina the
                 visuomotor transformation from motion-sensitive neurons in the
                 lobula plate [V2 and vertical system (VS) cells] onto premotor
                 descending neurons [descending neurons of the ocellar and
                 vertical system (DNOVS) cells] feeding into the motor circuit
                 of the fly thoracic ganglion. We found that each of these
                 cells is tuned to rotation of the fly around a particular body
                 axis. Comparing the responses of presynaptic and postsynaptic
                 cells revealed that DNOVS cells have approximately the same
                 tuning widths as V2 and VS cells. However, DNOVS signals cells
                 are less corrupted by fluctuations arising from the spatial
                 structure of the visual input than their presynaptic elements.
                 This leads to a more robust representation of ego-motion at
                 the level of descending neurons. Thus, when moving from lobula
                 plate cells to descending neurons, the selectivity for a
                 particular optic flow remains unaltered, but the robustness of

                 In addition, flies use a specialized class of inner PRs in the

                 relatively static, functional connectivity may change almost

                 Although nocturnal beetles move in the same manner through the
                 same environment as their diurnal relatives, they do so when
                 light conditions are at least 1 million-fold dimmer. Here, we
                 show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the celestial
                 cue preference differs between nocturnal and diurnal beetles
                 in a manner that reflects their contrasting visual ecologies.
                 We also demonstrate how these cue preferences are reflected in
                 the activity of compass neurons in the brain. At night,
                 polarized skylight is the dominant orientation cue for
                 nocturnal beetles. However, if we coerce them to roll during
                 the day, they instead use a celestial body (the sun) as their
                 primary orientation cue. Diurnal beetles, however, persist in
                 using a celestial body for their compass, day or night.
                 Compass neurons in the central complex of diurnal beetles are
                 tuned only to the sun, whereas the same neurons in the
                 nocturnal species switch exclusively to polarized light at
                 lunar light intensities. Thus, these neurons encode the
                 preferences for particular celestial cues and alter their
                 weighting according to ambient light conditions. This flexible
                 encoding of celestial cue preferences relative to the
                 prevailing visual scenery provides a simple, yet effective,
                 mechanism for enabling visual orientation at any light

                 movements and to cope with an extended bandwidth of sensory
                 stimuli. This is particularly true for flying animals because
                 flight, as opposed to walking or resting, imposes a steplike
                 increase in metabolism for the precise execution and control
                 of movements. Sensory processing itself carries a significant
                 metabolic cost, but the principles governing the adjustment of
                 sensory processing to different locomotor states are not well
                 understood. We use the blowfly as a model system to study the
                 impact on visual processing of a neuromodulator, octopamine,

                 rapid, large responses, and high spontaneous spike activity
                 could be adjusted by the neuromodulator octopamine, likely to

  author      = "Wilson, Martin",
  abstract    = "This paper examines the optical and physiological organisation
                 of locust ocelli with a view to understanding their function.
                 The approach taken in this work has largely been to correlate
                 quantitative measurements of the spectral, angular and
                 absolute sensitivities of large second order neurons with
                 radiometric data from the natural environment. The resulting
                 estimates of the natural performance of these neurons form the
                 basis for a hypothesis of their functional significance. 1. In
                 both median and lateral ocelli of adult locusts the image
                 plane lies well behind the retina regardless of pupil
                 diameter. It is pointed out that underfocussing confers
                 positive advantages and should be seen as an integral part of
                 ocellar design. 2. The ocellar nerves contain axons that carry
                 graded hyperpolarisations and axons that carry trains of
                 action potentials. Graded potentials are identified with the
                 large (L) neurons. The spiking axons, of which some are
                 light-inhibited and some are light-excited, are thought to be
                 the small (S) neurons. 3. Constriction of the radial pupil
                 during light adaptation causes little diminution of the total
                 field of view of an ocellus. The horizontal extent of the
                 visual fields of L neurons in lateral ocelli, measured
                 electrophysiologically is about 140°, effectively that of the
                 whole retina. These wide fields are consistent with the
                 underfocussed dioptrics and the reported extensive branching
                 of these cells in the subretinal neuropile. 4. Dark adaptation
                 of L neurons following normal preparative procedures takes
                 several hours and increases sensitivity by over 3 log units.
                 Complete dark adaptation is associated with large (up to 10 mV
                 average amplitude) hyperpolarising bumps clearly
                 distinguishable from noise and presumed to result from single
                 photon captures. 5. Using an index of sensitivity that relates
                 to monochromatic stimulation of an eye with an axial point
                 source it is estimated that L neurons are 5 $\times$ more
                 sensitive than compound eye lamina neurons but to an extended
                 source they would be 5000 $\times$ more sensitive. 6. Of 18 L
                 neurons whose spectral sensitivity was examined, all had
                 maximum sensitivity close to 370 nm. A secondary peak at 500
                 nm varied in height from cell to cell between 48\% and 0.3\%
                 of the UV peak. One cell was found in the median ocellus that
                 showed stronger inhibition from green than UV stimuli. It is
                 concluded that color coding by the ocellus is possible. 7. It
                 is suggested that the disposition of locust ocelli, the
                 spectral sensitivity and the temporal and spatial filtering
                 characteristics of their L neurons suit these cells well to
                 the task of detecting instability in flight. This idea is
                 discussed in relation to the anatomy and physiology of ocellar
                 pathways.",

                 aid in navigation, and to draw attention to salient features
                 like conspecifics or predators. Even figures that are similar
                 in pattern and luminance to the visual surroundings can be
                 distinguished by the optical disparity generated by their
                 relative motion against the ground, and yet the neural
                 mechanisms underlying these visual discriminations are not
                 well understood. We show in flies that a diverse array of
                 figure-ground stimuli containing a motion-defined edge elicit
                 statistically similar behavioral responses to one another, and
                 statistically distinct behavioral responses from ground motion
                 alone. From studies in larger flies and other insect species,
                 we hypothesized that the circuitry of the lobula--one of the
                 four, primary neuropiles of the fly optic lobe--performs this
                 visual discrimination. Using calcium imaging of input
                 dendrites, we then show that information encoded in cells
                 projecting from the lobula to discrete optic glomeruli in the
                 central brain group these sets of figure-ground stimuli in a
                 homologous manner to the behavior; ``figure-like'' stimuli are
                 coded similar to one another and ``ground-like'' stimuli are
                 encoded differently. One cell class responds to the leading
                 edge of a figure and is suppressed by ground motion. Two other
                 classes cluster any figure-like stimuli, including a figure
                 moving opposite the ground, distinctly from ground alone. This

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Arousal levels in the brain set thresholds for
                 behavior, from simple to complex. The mechanistic
                 underpinnings of the various phenomena comprising arousal,
                 however, are still poorly understood. Drosophila behaviors
                 have been studied that span different levels of arousal, from
                 sleep to visual perception to psychostimulant responses.
                 RESULTS: We have investigated neurobiological mechanisms of
                 arousal in the Drosophila brain by a combined behavioral,
                 genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approach.
                 Administration of methamphetamine (METH) suppresses sleep and
                 promotes active wakefulness, whereas an inhibitor of dopamine
                 synthesis promotes sleep. METH affects courtship behavior by
                 increasing sexual arousal while decreasing successful sexual
                 performance. Electrophysiological recordings from the medial
                 protocerebrum of wild-type flies showed that METH ingestion
                 has rapid and detrimental effects on a brain response
                 associated with perception of visual stimuli. Recordings in
                 genetically manipulated animals show that dopaminergic
                 transmission is required for these responses and that
                 visual-processing deficits caused by attenuated dopaminergic
                 transmission can be rescued by METH. CONCLUSIONS: We show that
                 changes in dopamine levels differentially affect arousal for
                 behaviors of varying complexity. Complex behaviors, such as
                 visual perception, degenerate when dopamine levels are either
                 too high or too low, in accordance with the inverted-U
                 hypothesis of dopamine action in the mammalian brain. Simpler
                 behaviors, such as sleep and locomotion, show graded responses
                 that follow changes in dopamine level.",

  abstract    = "Many of the similarities in visual ecology between the
                 Nematocera and Brachycera and within the Cyclorrhapha may
                 reflect the evolution of blood-feeding in these groups. In
                 Nematocera and Brachycera, blood-feeding is thought to have
                 evolved from predatory or nectar-feeding behavior (138). Only
                 females feed on hosts, and association with hosts generally
                 occurs when hosts are close to the aquatic or semiaquatic
                 habitats of the immatures. Flies feed on nectar, make
                 appetitive flights, disperse, or migrate prior to
                 blood-feeding, and then oviposit in water. Many species are
                 nocturnal or crepuscular. In Cyclorrhapha, flies are closely
                 associated with hosts. They may have arisen from
                 compost-feeding flies that developed a larval dependence on
                 vertebrate-produced microhabitats. Both sexes blood-feed, and
                 mating occurs on or near hosts. Flies generally emerge in the
                 proximity of hosts and maintain close contact with them. These
                 species are diurnal, and their visual systems are well
                 developed. Comparisons between closely related blood-feeding
                 and non-blood-feeding species may provide insight into the
                 visual ecology of blood-feeding species. Despite the different
                 origins of hematophagy, there appears to be a convergence of
                 morphology and behavior that is related to ecology rather than
                 to phylogenetic relationships. This is clearly seen in
                 host-location strategies by tsetse and tabanids. Even within
                 groups such as mosquitoes, species that are active at the same
                 time of day and in the same habitat have more in common than
                 closely related species in different habitats. For this
                 reason, an ecological review would be more cohesive than this
                 phylogenetic discussion. However, because of the
                 disproportionate amount of literature on a small number of
                 groups, the phylogenetic approach is the most practical for
                 this subject. However, this review does point out the great

                 strength of gaze-stabilizing optomotor reflexes to keep the
                 animal aligned within an invisible plume, facilitating odor

                 similarities with the ``Hx'' neuron identified in larger

                 visual responses by paired odor, and presynaptic inputs to the

                 suggesting that gaze stabilization is a crucial first step in
                 flight control. Unlike flies, hymenopteran insects such as
                 bees and wasps do not have halteres that provide fast,
                 feed-forward angular rate information to stabilize head
                 orientation in the presence of body rotations. We tested
                 whether hymenopteran insects use inertial (mechanosensory)

                 male Polistes humilis wasps flying in tether under different
                 visual conditions indoors and in natural outdoor conditions.
                 We oscillated the thorax of the insects with
                 frequency-modulated sinusoids (chirps) with frequencies
                 increasing from 0.2 to 2 Hz at a maximal amplitude of 50 deg

                 movements are purely visually driven. Modelling step responses
                 indicates that head roll stabilization is achieved by merging
                 information on head angular velocity, presumably provided by
                 motion-sensitive neurons and information on head orientation,

                 remains horizontal for most of the time to within $\pm$10 deg.
                 In free flight, we did not find a delay between spontaneous

                 activated by certain of these parameters. Two classes of
                 wide-field neurons have been identified that respond
                 selectively to looming and receding stimuli. Class 1 cells
                 respond to parameters of the image other than motion stimuli.
                 They discriminate an approaching or receding disc from an
                 outwardly or inwardly rotating spiral, being activated only by
                 the disc and not by the spiral. Class 2 neurons respond to
                 moving edges. They respond both to movement of the spiral and
                 to an approaching or receding disc. These two classes are
                 further subdivided into neurons that are excited by image
                 expansion (looming) and are inhibited by image contraction
                 (antilooming). Class 2 neurons also respond to horizontal and
                 vertical movement of gratings over the retina. Stimulating
                 class 1 and 2 neurons with white discs against a dark
                 background results in the same activation as stimulation with
                 dark discs against a white background, demonstrating that
                 changes in luminance play no role in the detection of looming
                 or antilooming. The present results show that the two types of
                 looming-sensitive neurons in M. sexta use different mechanisms
                 to detect the approach or retreat of an object. It is proposed
                 that cardinal parameters for this are change of perimeter
                 length detected by class 1 neurons and expansion or
                 contraction visual flow fields detected by class 2 neurons.
                 These two classes also differ with respect to their polarity,
                 the former comprising centripetal cells from the optic lobes
                 to the midbrain, the latter comprising centrifugal neurons
                 from the midbrain to the optic lobes. The significance of
                 these arrangements with respect to hovering flight is
                 discussed.",

                   the blowfly visual system, and present a theoretical
                   framework for analyzing the experimental results, starting
                   from the Poisson process. We find that blowfly
                   photoreceptors, up to frequencies of 50-100 Hz and photon
                   capture rates of up to about 3*10^5/s, operate well within
                   an order of magnitude from ideal photon counters.
                   Photoreceptors signals are transmitted to LMCs through an
                   array of chemical synapses. We quantify a lower bound on LMC
                   reliability, which in turn provides a lower bound on
                   synaptic vesicle release rate, assuming Poisson statistics.
                   This bound is much higher than what is found in published
                   direct measurements of vesicle release rates in goldfish
                   bipolar cells, suggesting that release statistics may be
                   significantly sub-Poisson. Finally we study H1, a motion
                   sensitive tangential cell in the fly's lobula plate, which
                   transmits information about a continuous signal by sequences

                   Comparing the measured reliability of H1's response to

                 based on intracellular recordings from neurons in the fly
                 visual system. Determining how insects detect and track small
                 moving features, often against cluttered moving backgrounds,
                 is an intriguing challenge, both from a physiological and a
                 computational perspective. Previous research has characterized
                 higher-order neurons within the fly brain, known as 'small
                 target motion detectors' (STMD), that respond robustly to
                 moving features, even when the velocity of the target is
                 matched to the background (i.e. with no relative motion cues).
                 We recorded from intermediate-order neurons in the fly visual
                 system that are well suited as a component along the target
                 detection pathway. This full-wave rectifying, transient cell
                 (RTC) reveals independent adaptation to luminance changes of
                 opposite signs (suggesting separate ON and OFF channels) and
                 fast adaptive temporal mechanisms, similar to other cell types
                 previously described. From this physiological data we have
                 created a numerical model for target discrimination. This
                 model includes nonlinear filtering based on the fly optics,
                 the photoreceptors, the 1(st) order interneurons (Large
                 Monopolar Cells), and the newly derived parameters for the
                 RTC. We show that our RTC-based target detection model is well
                 matched to properties described for the STMDs, such as
                 contrast sensitivity, height tuning and velocity tuning. The
                 model output shows that the spatiotemporal profile of small
                 targets is sufficiently rare within natural scene imagery to
                 allow our highly nonlinear 'matched filter' to successfully
                 detect most targets from the background. Importantly, this
                 model can explain this type of feature discrimination without
                 the need for relative motion cues.",

                 distracters. Dragonflies, for example, capture flies in swarms
                 comprising prey and conspecifics, a feat that requires neurons
                 to select one moving target from competing alternatives.
                 Diverse evidence, from functional imaging and physiology to
                 psychophysics, highlights the importance of such ``competitive
                 selection'' in attention for vertebrates. Analogous mechanisms
                 have been proposed in artificial intelligence and even in
                 invertebrates, yet direct neural correlates of attention are
                 scarce from all animal groups. Here, we demonstrate responses
                 from an identified dragonfly visual neuron that perfectly
                 match a model for competitive selection within limits of
                 neuronal variability (r(2) = 0.83). Responses to individual
                 targets moving at different locations within the receptive
                 field differ in both magnitude and time course. However,
                 responses to two simultaneous targets exclusively track those
                 for one target alone rather than any combination of the pair.
                 Irrespective of target size, contrast, or separation, this
                 neuron selects one target from the pair and perfectly
                 preserves the response, regardless of whether the ``winner''
                 is the stronger stimulus if presented alone. This neuron is
                 amenable to electrophysiological recordings, providing

                 does not follow the direction of luminance change. Such

                 butterfly and further complicated by its motion in and out of
                 shadows. Human subjects readily perceive the direction of
                 higher-order motion, although this stands in stark contrast to
                 prevailing motion vision models. Flies and humans compute
                 motion in similar ways, and because flies behaviorally track
                 bars containing higher-order motion cues, they become an
                 attractive model system for investigating the neurophysiology

                 directionally coding for elementary motion and figure motion,
                 respectively, and that responses to Fourier and theta motion
                 can be predicted from these. The sensitivity is affected both

                 also encode higher-order signals provided elaborate
                 preprocessing [2-4]. However, the way in which a fly tracks a
                 moving figure containing both elementary and higher-order
                 signals has not been investigated. Using a novel white noise

                 higher-order figure motion (FM) reflects the linear

                 tangential neurons is characteristic of a taxon and can differ
                 between taxa having different visual performances.
                 Observations of 12 brachyceran and 4 nematoceran species have
                 identified different behaviors associated with visually
                 stabilized flight. Neuroanatomical comparisons between closely
                 related species having different behaviors and
                 phylogenetically distant species that have similar behaviors
                 suggest that such differences relate to differences of giant
                 tangential cell architecture in the lobula plate. These
                 functionally related differences contrast to anatomical
                 features that reflect phylogenetic affinities. For example,
                 the lobula plates of robber flies, typified by ballistic
                 flight behavior, all differ from other taxa in lacking
                 cyclorrhaphan-type vertical motion-sensitive neurons; instead,
                 they possess an extra complement of horizontal cells in their
                 place. The results suggest that, although circuits that
                 compute elementary motion are conserved across the Diptera,
                 selective pressure has resulted in modifications of their
                 target neurons, thus contributing to the wide variety of

                 \textit{Syritta pipiens} {L}",
  author      = "Collett, T S and Land, M F",
  abstract    = "1.The visually guided flight behaviour of groups of male and
                 femaleSyritta pipiens was filmed at 50 f.p.s. and analysed
                 frame by frame. Sometimes the flies cruise around ignoring
                 each other. At other times males but not females track other
                 flies closely, during which the body axis points accurately
                 towards the leading fly.2.The eyes of males but not females
                 have a forward directed region of enlarged facets where the
                 resolution is 2 to 3 times greater than elsewhere. The
                 inter-ommatidial angle in this ``fovea'' is 0.6°.3.Targets
                 outside the fovea are fixated by accurately directed,
                 intermittent, open-loop body saccades. Fixation of moving
                 targets within the fovea is maintained by ``continuous''
                 tracking in which the angular position of the target on the
                 retina ($\Theta$e) is continuously translated into the angular
                 velocity of the tracking fly ($$\textbackslashdot
                 \textbackslashPhi _p $$) with a latency of roughly 20 ms
                 ($$\textbackslashdot \textbackslashPhi _p = k
                 \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek≏30 s−1).4.The tracking fly
                 maintains a roughly constant distance (in the range 5--15 cm)
                 from the target. If the distance between the two flies is more
                 than some set value the fly moves forwards, if it is less the
                 fly moves backwards. The forward or backward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p $$) increases with the difference
                 (D-D0) between the actual and desired distance
                 ($$\textbackslashdot F_p = k^\textbackslashprime (D - D_0
                 )$$), wherek′=10 to 20 s−1). It is argued that the fly
                 computes distance by measuring the vertical substense of the
                 target image on the retina.5.Angular tracking is sometimes, at
                 the tracking fly's choice,supplemented by changes in sideways
                 velocity. The fly predicts a suitable sideways velocity
                 probably on the basis of a running average$\Theta$e, but not
                 its instantaneous value. Alternatively, when the target is
                 almost stationary, angular tracking may bereplaced by sideways
                 tracking. In this case the sideways velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S$$) is related to$\Theta$eabout 30 ms
                 earlier ($$\textbackslashdot S_p = k\textbackslashprime
                 \textbackslashprime \textbackslashTheta _e $$, wherek″=2.5 cm
                 · s−1 · deg−1), and the angular tracking system is
                 inoperative.6.When the leading fly settles the tracking fly
                 often moves rapidly sideways in an arc centred on the leading
                 fly. During thesevoluntary sideways movements the male
                 continues to point his head at the target. He does this not by
                 correcting$\Theta$e, which is usually zero, but by predicting
                 the angular velocity needed to maintain fixation. This
                 prediction requires knowledge of both the distance between the
                 flies and the tracking fly's sideways velocity. It is shown
                 that the fly tends to over-estimate distance by about
                 20\%.7.When two males meet head on during tracking the pursuit
                 may be cut short as a result of vigorous sideways oscillations
                 of both flies. These side-to-side movements are synchronised
                 so that the males move in opposite directions, and the
                 oscillations usually grow in size until the males separate.
                 The angular tracking system is active during ``wobbling'' and
                 it is shown that to synchronise the two flies the sideways
                 tracking system must also be operative. The combined action of
                 both systems in the two flies leads to instability and so
                 provides a simple way of automatically separating two
                 males.8.Tracking is probably sexual in function and often
                 culminates in a rapid dart towards the leading fly, after the
                 latter has settled. During these ``rapes'' the male
                 accelerates continuously at about 500 cm · s−2, turning just
                 before it lands so that it is in the copulatory position. The
                 male rapes flies of either sex indicating that successful
                 copulation involves more trial and error than
                 recognition.9.During cruising flight the angular velocity of
                 the fly is zero except for brief saccadic turns. There is
                 often a sideways component to flight which means that the body
                 axis is not necessarily in the direction of flight. Changes in
                 flight direction are made either by means of saccades or by
                 adjusting the ratio of sideways to forward velocity
                 ($$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$). Changes in body
                 axis are frequently made without any change in the direction
                 of flight. On these occasions, when the fly makes an angular
                 saccade, it simultaneously adjusts$$\textbackslashdot
                 S/\textbackslashdot F$$by an appropriate amount.10.Flies
                 change course when they approach flowers using the same
                 variety of mechanisms: a series of saccades, adjustments
                 to$$\textbackslashdot S/\textbackslashdot F$$, or by a mixture
                 of the two.11.The optomotor response, which tends to prevent
                 rotation except during saccades, is active both during
                 cruising and tracking flight.",

                 have evolved multiple specializations to reduce this latency,
                 but the fastest feedback during flight involves a delay that
                 is still significant on the timescale of body dynamics. We
                 explored the effect of sensor delay on flight stability and
                 performance for yaw turns using a dynamically scaled robotic
                 model of the fruitfly, Drosophila. The robot was equipped with
                 a real-time feedback system that performed active turns in
                 response to measured torque about the functional yaw axis. We
                 performed system response experiments for a proportional
                 controller in yaw velocity for a range of feedback delays,
                 similar in dimensionless timescale to those experienced by a
                 fly. The results show a fundamental trade-off between sensor
                 delay and permissible feedback gain, and suggest that fast
                 mechanosensory feedback in flies, and most probably in other
                 insects, provide a source of active damping which compliments
                 that contributed by passive effects. Presented in the context

  abstract    = "In the blowfly, the direction-selective response of the 60
                 lobula-plate tangential cells has been ascribed to the
                 integration of local motion information across their extensive
                 dendritic trees. Because the lobula plate is organized
                 retinotopically, the receptive fields of the tangential cells
                 ought to be determined by their dendritic architecture.
                 However, this appears not always to be the case. One
                 compelling example is the exceptionally wide receptive fields
                 of the vertical system (VS) tangential cells. Using
                 dual-intracellular recordings, Haag and Borst (2004) found VS
                 cells to be mutually coupled in such a way that each VS cell
                 is connected exclusively to its immediate neighbors. This
                 coupling may form the basis of the broad receptive fields of
                 VS cells. Here, we tested this hypothesis directly by
                 photoablating individual VS cells. The receptive field width
                 of VS cells indeed narrowed after the ablation of single VS
                 cells, specifically depending on whether the receptive field
                 of the ablated cell was more frontal or more posterior to the
                 recorded cell. In particular, the responses changed as if the
                 neuron lost access to visual information from the ablated
                 neuron and those VS cells more distal than it from the
                 recorded neuron. These experiments provide strong evidence
                 that the lateral connections among VS cells are a crucial
                 component in the mechanism underlying their complex receptive
                 fields, augmenting the direct columnar input to their

                 hovering flight dynamics for dipteran insects. The
                 quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including
                 perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid
                 body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a
                 Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification
                 tools are used to identify the transfer functions from
                 biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states.
                 Stability derivatives and a state space linear system
                 describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle
                 control requirements are quantified with respect to
                 traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The
                 heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the
                 pitch/fore/aft dynamics. The haltere-on system revealed a
                 stabilized system with a slow (heave) and fast subsidence

                 their distinctive flight style. They can hover on the same
                 spot for several seconds and then burst into movement in
                 apparently any possible direction. In order to determine a
                 quantitative and structured description of complex flight
                 manoeuvres, we searched for a set of repeatedly occurring
                 prototypical movements (PMs) and a set of rules for their
                 ordering. PMs were identified by applying clustering
                 algorithms to the translational and rotational velocities of
                 the body of Eristalis during free-flight sequences. This
                 approach led to nine stable and reliable PMs, and thus
                 provided a tremendous reduction in the complexity of
                 behavioural description. This set of PMs together with the
                 probabilities of transition between them constitute a
                 syntactical description of flight behaviour. The PMs
                 themselves can be roughly segregated into fast rotational
                 turns (saccades) and a variety of distinct translational
                 movements (intersaccadic intervals). We interpret this
                 segregation as reflecting an active sensing strategy which
                 facilitates the extraction of spatial information from retinal
                 image displacements. Detailed analysis of saccades shows that
                 they are performed around all rotational axes individually and
                 in all possible combinations. We found the probability of
                 occurrence of a given saccade type to depend on parameters

                 images moving at velocities up to 3,000 degrees/sec (about 50
                 Hz contrast frequency for gratings of spatial wavelength 15
                 degrees). To investigate the neural basis of these movements
                 we have combined videomicroscopy with electrophysiological
                 stimulation and recording to demonstrate that excitation of
                 prothoracic motor neurons projecting in the anterodorsal (ADN)
                 and frontal nerves (FN), respectively, generates the yaw and
                 roll head movements measured behaviorally. Electrical
                 stimulation of the ADN produces head yaw. The visual stimuli
                 which excite the two ADN motor neurons (ADN MNs) are
                 horizontal motion of gratings or spots moving clockwise around
                 the yaw axis in the case of the right ADN (counterclockwise
                 for left ADN). Activity is inhibited by motion in the opposite
                 direction. Spatial sensitivity varies in the yaw plane with a
                 maximum between 0 degree and 40 degrees ipsilaterally, but
                 both excitation and inhibition are elicited out to 80 degrees
                 in the ipsilateral and contralateral fields. ADN MNs respond
                 to contrast frequencies up to 15-20 Hz, with a peak around 2-4
                 Hz for grating motion in the excitatory or inhibitory
                 directions. Electrical stimulation of the FN primarily elicits
                 roll down to the ipsilateral side. The one FN MN consistently
                 driven by visual stimulation is excited by downward motion and
                 inhibited by upward motion at 80 degrees azimuth in the
                 ipsilateral visual field. At -80 degrees contralateral, visual
                 motion has the opposite effect: Upward is excitatory and
                 downward is inhibitory. The FN MN is tuned to contrast
                 frequencies in the same range as the ADN MNs, with peak
                 sensitivity around 4 Hz. The functional organization of inputs

                 system}",
  author      = "Huston, S J and Krapp, H G",
  abstract    = "For sensory signals to control an animal's behavior, they must
                 first be transformed into a format appropriate for use by its
                 motor systems. This fundamental problem is faced by all
                 animals, including humans. Beyond simple reflexes, little is
                 known about how such sensorimotor transformations take place.
                 Here we describe how the outputs of a well- characterized
                 population of fly visual interneurons, lobula plate tangential
                 cells (LPTCs), are used by the animal's gaze- stabilizing neck
                 motor system. The LPTCs respond to visual input arising from
                 both self-rotations and translations of the fly. The neck
                 motor system however is involved in gaze stabilization and
                 thus mainly controls compensatory head rotations. We
                 investigated how the neck motor system is able to selectively
                 extract rotation information from the mixed responses of the
                 LPTCs. We recorded extracellularly from fly neck motor neurons
                 (NMNs) and mapped the directional preferences across their
                 extended visual receptive fields. Our results suggest
                 that---like the tangential cells---NMNs are tuned to panoramic
                 retinal image shifts, or optic flow fields, which occur when
                 the fly rotates about particular body axes. In many cases,
                 tangential cells and motor neurons appear to be tuned to
                 similar axes of rotation, resulting in a correlation between
                 the coordinate systems the two neural populations employ.
                 However, in contrast to the primarily monocular receptive
                 fields of the tangential cells, most NMNs are sensitive to
                 visual motion presented to either eye. This results in the
                 NMNs being more selective for rotation than the LPTCs. Thus,
                 the neck motor system increases its rotation selectivity by a
                 comparatively simple mechanism: the integration of binocular
                 visual motion information.",

  abstract    = "Animals use information from multiple sensory organs to
                 generate appropriate behavior. Exactly how these different
                 sensory inputs are fused at the motor system is not well
                 understood. Here we study how fly neck motor neurons integrate
                 information from two well characterized sensory systems:
                 visual information from the compound eye and gyroscopic
                 information from the mechanosensory halteres. Extracellular
                 recordings reveal that a subpopulation of neck motor neurons
                 display ``gating-like'' behavior: they do not fire action
                 potentials in response to visual stimuli alone but will do so
                 if the halteres are coactivated. Intracellular recordings show
                 that these motor neurons receive small, sustained subthreshold
                 visual inputs in addition to larger inputs that are phase
                 locked to haltere movements. Our results suggest that the
                 nonlinear gating-like effect results from summation of these
                 two inputs with the action potential threshold providing the
                 nonlinearity. As a result of this summation, the sustained
                 visual depolarization is transformed into a temporally
                 structured train of action potentials synchronized to the
                 haltere beating movements. This simple mechanism efficiently
                 fuses two different sensory signals and may also explain the

                 move. Indeed, recent studies found differences between
                 responses of sensory neurons in resting versus moving insects.
                 Since the dynamic range of visual motion stimuli strongly
                 depends on the speed at which an animal is moving, we
                 investigated whether the visual system adapts to such changes

                 and head, keeping their gaze basically fixed between saccades.
                 For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic
                 flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly
                 motion pathway to extract information about translation of the
                 animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the
                 environment. There are noticeable differences between head and
                 body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and
                 shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more
                 stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we
                 analyse the functional importance of these differences by
                 probing visual interneurons of the blowfly motion pathway with
                 optic flow based on either head movements or body movements,
                 as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique.
                 We find that the precise head-body coordination is essential
                 for the visual system to separate the translational from the
                 rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the
                 body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the
                 behaviourally important information on translation. Since it
                 is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental
                 paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video
                 techniques, we introduce a 'headifying algorithm', which
                 transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight
                 into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application
                 of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation
                 between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable
                 recovering information on translation. The algorithm may
                 therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed

  abstract    = "Humans, animals and some mobile robots use visual motion cues
                 for object detection and navigation in structured
                 surroundings. Motion is commonly sensed by large arrays of
                 small field movement detectors, each preferring motion in a
                 particular direction. Self-motion generates distinct 'optic
                 flow fields' in the eyes that depend on the type and direction
                 of the momentary locomotion (rotation, translation). To
                 investigate how the optic flow is processed at the neuronal
                 level, we recorded intracellularly from identified
                 interneurons in the third visual neuropile of the blowfly. The
                 distribution of local motion tuning over their huge receptive
                 fields was mapped in detail. The global structure of the
                 resulting 'motion response fields' is remarkably similar to
                 optic flow fields. Thus, the organization of the receptive
                 fields of the so-called VS neurons strongly suggests that each
                 of these neurons specifically extracts the rotatory component
                 of the optic flow around a particular horizontal axis. Other
                 neurons are probably adapted to extract translatory flow
                 components. This study shows how complex visual discrimination
                 can be achieved by task-oriented preprocessing in single
                 neurons.",

  author      = "Land, M F",
  abstract    = "Nearly all animals with good vision have a repertoire of eye
                 movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                 with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                 movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                 in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                 gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                 results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                 Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                 about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                 insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                 rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                 need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                 imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                 third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                 prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                 which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                 of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                 and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                 jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                 scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                 during orientation flights at speeds of 100-200 degrees s-1.
                 This is just consistent with a blur-free image, as are the
                 scanning speeds of the animals with linear retinae.",

                 interneurons during tethered flight, but this technique
                 generalizes to different cell types and behaviors. We found
                 that the peak-to-peak responses of a class of visual

                 not fixed, but is instead behaviorally flexible and changes
                 with locomotor state. Using voltage clamp, we found that the

  abstract    = "Most insects have simple eyes (ocelli), in addition to
                 compound eyes. Although the ocelli can detect only changes in
                 light intensity averaged over their large visual field, they
                 do play various roles in the behavior of insects, as they have
                 advantages over compound eyes in terms of photic sensitivity
                 and the speed of signal transmission. I summarize here our
                 present knowledge on the neural organization of ocellar
                 systems of a number of insects, and propose that they can be
                 classified into three types: (1) the ``cockroach type''
                 ocellar system where signals from the photoreceptors first
                 converge onto a small number of second-order neurons, and then
                 diverge to a large number of third-order neurons which project
                 into a number of target neuropils of the brain; (2) the ``bee
                 type'' ocellar system where photoreceptor signals are passed
                 to various target neuropils by a large number of second-order
                 neurons; and (3) the ``locust type'' ocellar system where
                 ocellar signals are transmitted to various target neuropils by
                 both second- and third-order neurons. I propose that: (1) the
                 ``cockroach type'' ocellar system can be characterized as a
                 sensitive type where higher sensitivity is attained because of
                 the higher ratio of convergence of photoreceptor signals onto
                 second-order neurons; (2) the ``bee type'' ocellar system is a
                 fast type where a high speed of signal transmission is
                 attained at the possible cost of sensitivity; and (3) the
                 ``locust type'' ocellar system is an intermediate type where
                 both speed and sensitivity are emphasized. A possible
                 phylogenetic relationship between the three types of ocellar
                 systems is discussed.",

                 important for the blowfly, whose aerodynamic instability
                 permits outstanding maneuverability but increases the demands
                 placed on flight control. Flies use several sensory systems to
                 drive reflex responses, and recent studies have provided
                 access to the circuitry responsible for combining and
                 employing these sensory inputs. We report that lobula plate VS
                 neurons combine inputs from two optical sensors, the ocelli
                 and the compound eyes. Both systems deliver essential
                 information on in-flight rotations, but our neuronal

                 three axes, whereas the compound eyes encode in nine. The
                 difference in dimensionality is reconciled by tuning each VS

                 neurons can transmit between 5 and 30 bits of information per
                 second in response to rapidly varying, pseudorandom stimuli,

                 use a firing-rate code to transmit information, the evidence

  abstract    = "Flying insects exhibit stunning behavioral repertoires that
                 are largely mediated by the visual control of flight. For this
                 reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered
                 insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for
                 studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create
                 an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual
                 stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels
                 composed of an 8 x 8 array of individual LEDs, that may be
                 connected together to 'tile' an experimental environment with
                 controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be
                 extremely bright, with the added flexibility of
                 individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation
                 over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions.
                 Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom
                 software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on
                 the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication
                 interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based
                 display controller which, for most experiments, will not
                 require a computer in the loop, greatly reducing the

  abstract    = "Behavioural responses of an animal are variable even when the
                 animal experiences the same sensory input several times. This
                 variability can arise from stochastic processes inherent to
                 the nervous system. Also, the internal state of an animal may
                 influence a particular behavioural response. In the present
                 study, we analyse the variability of visually induced head
                 pitch responses of tethered blowflies by high-speed
                 cinematography. We found these optomotor responses to be
                 highly variable in amplitude. Most of the variability can be
                 attributed to two different internal states of the flies with
                 high and low optomotor gain, respectively. Even within a given
                 activity state, there is some variability of head optomotor
                 responses. The amount of this variability differs for the two
                 optomotor gain states. Moreover, these two activity states can
                 be distinguished on a fine timescale and without visual
                 stimulation, on the basis of the occurrence of peculiar head
                 jitter movements. Head jitter goes along with high gain
                 optomotor responses and haltere oscillations. Halteres are
                 evolutionary transformed hindwings that oscillate when
                 blowflies walk or fly. Their main function is to serve as
                 equilibrium organs by detecting Coriolis forces and to mediate
                 gaze stabilisation. However, their basic oscillating activity
                 was also suggested to provide a gain-modulating signal. Our
                 experiments demonstrate that halteres are not necessary for
                 high gain head pitch to occur. Nevertheless, we find the
                 halteres to be responsible for one component of head jitter
                 movements. This component may be the inevitable consequence of
                 their function as equilibrium and gaze-stabilising organs.",

                 motion. To probe how visual systems process compound motion
                 patterns, superimposed visual gratings moving in different
                 directions, plaid stimuli, have been successfully used in
                 vertebrates. Surprisingly, nothing is known about how visually
                 guided insects process plaids. Here, we explored in the
                 blowfly how the well characterized yaw optomotor reflex and
                 the activity of identified visual interneurons depend on plaid
                 stimuli. We show that contrary to previous expectations, the
                 yaw optomotor reflex shows a bimodal directional tuning for
                 certain plaid stimuli. To understand the neural correlates of
                 this behavior, we recorded the responses of a visual
                 interneuron supporting the reflex, the H1 cell, which was also
                 bimodally tuned to the plaid direction. Using a computational
                 model, we identified the essential neural processing steps
                 required to capture the observed response properties. These
                 processing steps have functional parallels with mechanisms
                 found in the primate visual system, despite different
                 biophysical implementations. By characterizing other visual
                 neurons supporting visually guided behaviors, we found
                 responses that ranged from being bimodally tuned to the
                 stimulus direction (component-selective), to responses that
                 appear to be tuned to the direction of the global pattern

                 understanding of neural mechanisms of motion processing in
                 insects, and indicate that the fly employs a wider range of

                 the efficient estimation and control of their self-motion. To
                 stabilize their gaze relative to the environment, flies turn
                 their head in response to changes in flight attitude. These
                 compensatory head movements occur with short delays, at high

                 Innovative behavioural experiments are needed to elucidate the

                 stimulus and response components after 40 ms processing time

  abstract    = "Insects have evolved sophisticated fight control mechanisms
                 permitting a remarkable range of manoeuvres. Here, I present a
                 qualitative analysis of insect flight control from the
                 perspective of flight mechanics, drawing upon both the
                 neurophysiology and biomechanics literatures. The current
                 literature does not permit a formal, quantitative analysis of
                 flight control, because the aerodynamic force systems that
                 biologists have measured have rarely been complete and the
                 position of the centre of gravity has only been recorded in a
                 few studies. Treating the two best-known insect orders
                 (Diptera and Orthoptera) separately from other insects, I
                 discuss the control mechanisms of different insects in detail.
                 Recent experimental studies suggest that the helicopter model
                 of flight control proposed for Drosophila spp. may be better
                 thought of as a facultative strategy for flight control,
                 rather than the fixed (albeit selected) constraint that it is
                 usually interpreted to be. On the other hand, the so-called
                 'constant-lift reaction' of locusts appears not to be a reflex
                 for maintaining constant lift at varying angles of attack, as
                 is usually assumed, but rather a mechanism to restore the
                 insect to pitch equilibrium following a disturbance.
                 Differences in the kinematic control mechanisms used by the
                 various insect orders are related to differences in the
                 arrangement of the wings, the construction of the flight motor
                 and the unsteady mechanisms of lift production that are used.
                 Since the evolution of insect flight control is likely to have
                 paralleled the evolutionary refinement of these unsteady
                 aerodynamic mechanisms, taxonomic differences in the
                 kinematics of control could provide an assay of the relative
                 importance of different unsteady mechanisms. Although the
                 control kinematics vary widely between orders, the number of
                 degrees of freedom that different insects can control will
                 always be limited by the number of independent control inputs
                 that they use. Control of the moments about all three axes (as
                 used by most conventional aircraft) has only been proven for
                 larger flies and dragonflies, but is likely to be widespread
                 in insects given the number of independent control inputs
                 available to them. Unlike in conventional aircraft, however,
                 insects' control inputs are likely to be highly
                 non-orthogonal, and this will tend to complicate the neural
                 processing required to separate the various motions.",

  abstract    = "In the absence of much passive stability, flying insects rely
                 upon active stabilisation, necessitating the provision of rich
                 sensory feedback across a range of modalities. Here we
                 consider from a sensory perspective what quantities flying
                 insects measure, in order to ask from a mechanical perspective
                 why they should want to do so. We consider each of the sensory
                 modalities separately and uncover three general principles.
                 Firstly, we find that insects have evolved to measure changes
                 in kinematic state, rather than absolute state. For example,
                 although the antennae may be loosely thought of as airspeed
                 sensors, we show that they are configured as a sophisticated
                 adaptive sensing system which is much more appropriate for
                 measuring changes in airspeed than absolute airspeed.
                 Secondly, we find that insect sensory systems are tuned to
                 sense self-motion components in specific directions. For
                 example, certain visual interneurons of flies operate as
                 matched filters that are tuned to detect the optic flow fields
                 induced specifically by rotation about one particular axis.
                 Thirdly, we find that insects commonly combine sensory input
                 from across modalities to form composite, multi-modal
                 quantities which they use as feedback to the control system.
                 For example, certain individually identified descending
                 interneurons combine input from the compound eyes, ocelli,
                 antennae, and cephalic wind-sensitive hairs into one composite
                 signal which is then used in flight control. We infer from
                 these three general organisational principles that insects are
                 configured to sense excitation of their natural modes of
                 motion. This natural-mode sensing hypothesis: (1) explains why
                 insects should want to sense changes in state rather than
                 absolute state; (2) predicts what specific directions of
                 motion they should sense, and (3) specifies how sensory input
                 from different modalities should be combined.",

  author      = "Taylor, Graham K and Zbikowski, Rafal",
  abstract    = "Previous studies of insect flight control have been
                 statistical in approach, simply correlating wing kinematics
                 with body kinematics or force production. Kinematics and
                 forces are linked by Newtonian mechanics, so adopting a
                 dynamics-based approach is necessary if we are to place the
                 study of insect flight on its proper physical footing. Here we
                 develop semi-empirical models of the longitudinal flight
                 dynamics of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria. We use
                 instantaneous force-moment measurements from individual
                 locusts to parametrize the nonlinear rigid body equations of
                 motion. Since the instantaneous forces are approximately
                 periodic, we represent them using Fourier series, which are
                 embedded in the equations of motion to give a nonlinear
                 time-periodic (NLTP) model. This is a proper mathematical
                 generalization of an earlier linear-time invariant (LTI) model
                 of locust flight dynamics, developed using previously
                 published time-averaged versions of the instantaneous force
                 recordings. We perform various numerical simulations, within
                 the fitted range of the model, and across the range of body
                 angles used by free-flying locusts, to explore the likely
                 behaviour of the locusts upon release from the tether.
                 Solutions of the NLTP models are compared with solutions of
                 the nonlinear time-invariant (NLTI) models to which they
                 reduce when the periodic terms are dropped. Both sets of
                 models are unstable and therefore fail to explain locust
                 flight stability fully. Nevertheless, whereas the measured
                 forces include statistically significant harmonic content up
                 to about the eighth harmonic, the simulated flight
                 trajectories display no harmonic content above the fundamental
                 forcing frequency. Hence, manoeuvre control in locusts will
                 not directly reflect subtle changes in the higher harmonics of
                 the wing beat, but must operate on a coarser time-scale. A
                 state-space analysis of the NLTP models reveals orbital
                 trajectories that are impossible to capture in the LTI and
                 NLTI models, and inspires the hypothesis that asymptotic
                 orbital stability is the proper definition of stability in
                 flapping flight. Manoeuvre control on the scale of more than
                 one wing beat would then consist in exciting transients from
                 one asymptotically stable orbit to another. We summarize these
                 hypotheses by proposing a limit-cycle analogy for flapping
                 flight control and suggest experiments for verification of the
                 limit-cycle control analogy hypothesis.",

                 tuning, firing rate or gain. All of these factors must be
                 considered to understand how two neurons should be coupled to
                 optimally process stimuli. We quantified the functional effect
                 of an interaction between two optic-flow processing neurons

                 model, we estimated a uni-directional coupling from H1 to Vi.
                 Especially at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the coupling

                 heavily on the optic flow perceived by the animal during
                 flight. The processing of optic flow is performed in
                 motion-sensitive tangential cells of the lobula plate, which
                 are well described with respect to their visual response
                 properties and the connectivity among them. However, little is
                 known about the postsynaptic descending neurons, which convey
                 motion information to the motor circuits in the thoracic
                 ganglion. Here we investigate the physiology and connectivity
                 of an identified premotor descending neuron, called DNOVS2
                 (for descending neuron of the ocellar and vertical system). We
                 find that DNOVS2 is tuned in a supralinear way to rotation
                 around the longitudinal body axis. Experiments involving
                 stimulation of the ipsilateral and the contralateral eye
                 indicate that ipsilateral computation of motion information is
                 modified nonlinearly by motion information from the
                 contralateral eye. Performing double recordings of DNOVS2 and
                 lobula plate tangential cells, we find that DNOVS2 is
                 connected ipsilaterally to a subset of vertical-sensitive
                 cells. From the contralateral eye, DNOVS2 receives input most
                 likely from V2, a heterolateral spiking neuron. This specific
                 neural circuit is sufficient for the tuning of DNOVS2, making

                 binocular integration of visual motion information underlying
                 a head optomotor response. We identified and characterized two
                 cervical nerve motor neurons (called CNMN6 and CNMN7) tuned
                 precisely to an optic flow corresponding to pitch movements of

                 determined that these neurons are connected ipsilaterally to
                 two vertical system cells (VS2 and VS3), and contralaterally
                 to one horizontal system cell (HSS). In addition, CNMN7 turned

  abstract    = "Apparent motion stimuli of increasing complexity have been
                 applied to analyse the mechanisms underlying visual motion
                 perception. In the present paper it is investigated how motion
                 detectors respond to three classes of stimuli which are
                 realized as random-dot kinematograms. (i) In the most
                 conventional stimuli, Fourier motion, a group of dots is
                 displaced coherently in a random-dot pattern (ii) In
                 drift-balanced motion stimuli a bar made of static random dots
                 is shifted in front of another random-dot pattern (iii) In the
                 novel class of stimuli, theta motion, an object which is
                 exclusively defined by dot motion into one direction, is
                 moving itself into the opposite direction. It is shown in
                 psychophysical experiments that human observers perceive the
                 direction of object motion in all three classes of stimuli.
                 Simple motion detectors, however, only extract the motion
                 direction of the object in the case of Fourier stimuli, and in
                 the case of drift-balanced stimuli, if a nonlinear
                 preprocessing is assumed. Any of the model alternatives
                 discussed so far just detects the moving dots but not the
                 object in a theta-stimulus, as is illustrated by a
                 combinatorial analysis using a simplified version of a motion
                 detector of the correlation type, which operates on a discrete
                 time scale and takes only discrete values. In order to account
                 for the detection of theta-motion, a model consisting of two
                 hierarchical layers of motion detectors is developed, and
                 simulated for conditions as used in the psychophysical
                 experiments. The perception of theta-motion and the two-layer
                 model is discussed in relation to psychophysical data and
                 theoretical considerations from the literature, to try to
                 incorporate the proposed two-layer model into a general scheme

                 about 3 · 105/s, operate well within an order of magnitude
                 from ideal photon counters. Photoreceptors signals are
                 transmitted to LMCs through an array of chem- ical synapses.
                 We quantify a lower bound on LMC reliability, which in turn
                 provides a lower bound on synaptic vesicle release rate,

                 what is found in published direct measurements of vesicle
                 release rates in goldfish bipolar cells, suggesting that

                 movements of the thorax are compensated by counter rolls of
                 the head relative to the thorax. The yaw turns of the thorax

                 saccades. Blowfly flight can be divided into two sets of
                 episodes: 'during saccades', when high angular velocities of

  abstract    = "Among other sensory modalities, flight stabilization in
                 insects is performed with the aid of visual feedback from
                 three simple eyes (ocelli). It is thought that each ocellus
                 acts as a single wide-field sensor that detects changes in
                 light intensity. We challenge this notion by providing
                 evidence that, when light-adapted, the large retinal L-neurons
                 in the median ocellus of the dragonfly respond in a
                 directional way to upward moving bars and gratings. This
                 ability is pronounced under UV illumination but weak or
                 nonexistent in green light and is optimal at angular
                 velocities of approximately 750 degrees s(-1). Using a
                 reverse-correlation technique, we analyze the functional
                 organization of the receptive fields of the L-neurons. Our
                 results reveal that L-neurons alter the structure of their
                 linear spatiotemporal receptive fields with changes in the
                 illuminating wavelength, becoming more inseparable and
                 directional in UV light than in green. For moving bars and
                 gratings, the strength of directionality predicted from the
                 receptive fields is consistent with the measured values. Our
                 results strongly suggest that, during the day, the retinal
                 circuitry of the dragonfly median ocellus performs an early
                 linear stage of motion processing. The likely advantage of
                 this computation is to enhance pitch control.",
